Id;anno;Abstract
1;1967;Beginning with a sample of 497 Ss, multiple criteria of religiosity were applied to obtain a truly religious group of 210 Ss. Utilizing a factorially stable measure of prejudice, extreme religious-prejudiced (29 Ss) and religious-unprejudiced (32 Ss)groups were formed. Committed and Consensual religious orientations were then hypothesized on the basis of five cognitive perspectives which were operationally derived from interviews. Strong correspondence was demonstrated between prejudice and Consensual religion and between absence of prejudice and Committed faith. Many additional distinctions in social and religious outlooks were also evidenced, thus clarifying further the nature of religion-prejudice relationships.
2;1967;"Disagreements over definitions and consequent difficulties in precise measurement have obscured the study of the relationships among pluralism, religion, and secularism. But the importance of those relationships requires that we attempt to explore them. An emphasis on pluralism, it is suggested, supports religious freedom and tolerance, but it may also support rigidity in religious traditions. Defense of separate religious communities may transfer questions of social integration to secular institutions that are at least potentially anti-religious; or it may promote anomie. Substantial amounts of secularism, so often defined as antithetical to religion, may actually be essential if religiously pluralistic societies are to escape high levels of conflict. Thus religiously heterogeneous societies are confronted with serious dilemmas. The numerous and subtle relationships among pluralism, religion, and secularism call for careful analysis."
3;1967;In both empirical research and interpretation today there is a total lack of agreement as to what secularization is and how to measure it. The present paper tries to bring the concept of secularization into focus by considering 1) the history of the term, 2) six types of usage today and their application in selected examples of research, 3) a critique of these forms of secularization concept as analytical tools, and 4) a critique of the secular-religious polarity. It is concluded that the term secularization, because of its polemical past, its extremely varied definitions, and its frequent use as a blanket term to cover several disparate processes, should either be abandoned or be explicitly recognized as a comprehensive term covering three complementary but distinct processes, desacralization, differentiation and transposition.
4;1967;Instances of political behavior which bear no rational relationship to maximizing a group's material and social self-interest may be explained as responses to subcultural factors. Religious groups in America, despite their generally high level of acculturation, still retain ethical and belief systems which influence basic conservative-liberal political orientations. The criteria used to distinguish sect from church seem to be of less importance in shaping political predispositions than beliefs centering around revealed dogma, salvation, impulse life, intellectualism vs. faith, and the nature of evil. The cultural belief systems of the various denominations operate as independent variables within the social structure.
5;1967;Members of the Baha'i World Faith consistently differed from Jews, Catholics, Protestants, and non-affiliates in the structure of religious behavior and its relation to personality. By factor analysis of 35 religious behaviors of 112 Baha'is, five facets or components of their total religious life were found: Cognitive, Experiential, Self-defining, Administrative, and Meditative. Evidence suggesting possible psychosocial functions of these components was considered. Strength on all five components at once--total, balanced religious activity--was found only in the Baha'i group. This unique Baha'i pattern in the religious realm was correlated with a personal orientation composed of World-minded, Spontaneous, and Adaptive behaviors, which was found only in the Baha'i group. A deviation from total religious participation is associated with disruption of the unique personality pattern, and vice versa. These findings are also discussed in terms of a concept of community.
6;1967;Mystic experiences have been classically associated with mountainous or desert places. The experiences of a hypnotized and a simulating subject are compared under suggestions which enhance and eliminate perceived depth, increase and decrease visual clarity, and under control conditions. These are in turn contrasted with the responses of a previously reported subject under these same conditions. Mystic experience seems associated with increased depth suggestions, schizophreniform experience with no depth. These effects are not produced by altering visual clarity. Mystic and schizophrenic states may be opposite to one another. The interaction of objects in the environment with space seems crucial in producing either.
7;1967;One hundred and sixty elementary school children were individually interviewed regarding their conception of prayer and the affects and fantasies associated with prayer activity. The prayer concept seemed to develop in three stages which were related to age. At the first stage (ages 5-7), children had a global conception of prayer in the sense that their comprehension of the term was both vague and fragmentary. Children at the second stage (ages 7-9) had a concrete differentiated conception of prayer and recognized that it involved verbal activity. At this stage, however, prayer was still an external activity, a routine form, rather than personal and internal. At the third stage (ages 9-12), children had an abstract prayer conception in the sense that it was regarded as an internal activity deriving from personal conviction and belief. Only at the third stage did prayer emerge as a true communication between the child and what he considered divine, between the I and the Thou. With increasing age, the content of prayer also changed from egocentric wish fulfillment (candy, toys, etc.) to altruistic moral and ethical desires (peace on earth, etc.). At the same time, affects associated with prayer activity became less impulsive and more modulated among the older children while prayer came to be a deeper and more satisfying experience. The fantasy activity associated with prayer changed from a belief that prayers were self-propelled missiles to the view that they were a form of direct communication with God. The results are discussed from the developmental point of view and the parallel between the development of prayer in the child and in Western civilization is pointed out.
8;1967;"Sociological aspects of missionary activity are analyzed via a review of relevant literature. Two major strategies are identified, one oriented mainly toward social systems and the other toward individuals; the strategies appear to be associated with variations in the parent institution and the congregation of converts. Missionary tactics relate in part to types of ""opinion change"" postulated social psychologically; tactics also are aimed at dealing with structural conflicts between native and foreign sociocultural systems. Receptivity to religious innovations is found to increase under conditions of disorganization, a finding which fits current theories of value-oriented social movements. Foreign churches often are rejected if their social organization is too dissimilar to native patterns; further, the indigenous social organization, especially the ranking and kinship systems, channels diffusion."
9;1967;The church-sect typology has come under increasing criticism as a tool for research in the sociology of religion. It is a problem which is inherent in the construction of and use of ideal types. Troeltsch's work is re-examined and it is argued that the central characteristics originally used were (1) a universalistic-particularistic thrust in the mission of the religious unit, and (2) an objective-subjective means to the attainment of Grace. These were correlated in cases Troeltsch considered, but may not be in others. This provides us with four possible categories for classification of church organizations, UO-US-PS-PO (although the last is so inherently inconsistent as to be an empty category).
10;1967;The concept of ecstasy has appeared in the writings of several important social theorists, for example Weber, Freud, and Mannheim. It is used to describe a mode of experience, very intense, probably of short duration, in which the person feels removed from himself and everyday life. The sociological problem is how this anti-institutional experience is in fact institutionalized by the social forms of religion, art, love, etc., all of which compete for control over the expression of ecstatic behavior. Individuals appear to require alternative kinds of experience to the struggles of everyday life. Ecstatic experience as a particularly highly-charged alternative which can be a powerful engine for social change. The struggle for control of ecstatic expression appears relatively tangential to the more mundane struggles for power.
11;1967;"The minister and members of a conservative church were administered Q-sorts consisting of 56 items assessing religious orientation. These items were derived from interviews with members of the congregation. Factor analysis provided three distinct orientations, or hypothetical types of persons. The authority-seeker wants the minister to ""lay it on the line"" and tell the congregation what it should and should not do. He wants bold and forcible criticism as well as strong guidance. The comfort-seeker is afraid of death and Hell, illness and old age, and the church helps him reduce his fears. It gives him peace of mind by its assurance of eternal life. The social participator enjoys the friendly social interaction and an opportunity to talk with others about matters of mutual interest. The church is a kind of social ""home"", where he can enjoy human companionship."
12;1967;"The null-hypothesis that ""religion"" is unidimensional was tested on a local sample of Methodists. Relevant literature was examined for possible dimensions. Eleven were found or constructed and 121 questionnaire items covering many aspects of individual belief and congregational involvement were selected as possible indicators. Factor and cluster analyses were used. Sixteen factors and twelve clusters of some interest were obtained. Agreements between the analyses led to the conclusions that: 1. For these data, the unidimensional view should be rejected; 2. Nine dimensions can be presented for further study, several of which are similar to some previously proposed in the literature."
13;1967;"The true mystic is one who seeks to reconstitute the fragmented elements of experience, not to arrive at a conceptual synthesis, but to replace normal consciousness with spiritual chaos. In this state the mystic is able to renew himself by regression to an undifferentiated state of consciousness, in which there is no longer self or ""other."" It is only by regression to the most archaic levels of religious feeling that one can penetrate the disguises of God, experiencing him as reality, and not as mythical hero or benign father-figure. In this sense, mysticism is different from the attitude of ritual devotion, which stubbornly refuses to repudiate its Adamic nature. The mystic dares to cast off his ego, and along with it, the expectations of others. In this way he replaces the tyranny of the self and of others by the absolute freedom of his surrender to holiness."
14;1967;This paper is a comparative study of three Pentecostal sects, two in Chile and one in Brazil. Opposing the traditional class system in which they rank low, the Pentecostal sects seek to shape their own structure after an egalitarian model in which all criteria of conventional ranking as practiced by the wider society are rejected. In reality, however, compromise with authoritarian principles seems rather common. Comparison of the three cases shows that the closer a sect comes to the egalitarian model the more its leaders feel the need to validate their authority by seeking supernatural sanctions for their decisions.
15;1967;Three basic problems with the church-sect dimension are raised: its definition, empirical correlates, and the association of its defining elements. The last question is examined in detail. Several elements presumed to be essential to a definition of church-sect are demonstrated to have no basis in fact. A re-examination of the concept is called for.
16;1967;What is the subject matter of the study of religion? Is it the external expression of religious persons and communities, i.e., the historical deposit of sacred scriptures, theologies, social institutions, ethical and liturgical prescriptions and practices? Accurate observation and description of these data and analysis to detect common structures are important and necessary. This is not, however, primary, since it excludes from its purview the personal meaning these external traditions possess for their participants. This objection suggests that enquiry should focus on the existential selfhood of individual communicants. Yet this, also, is unsatisfactory because it restricts study to the psychology of individuals. Research should concentrate, instead, on religious faith, i.e., existential selfhood or personal faith as this is evoked and expressed by an historical tradition. This entails discerning how items in a cumulative religious tradition enter into the believer's faith or selfhood by being existentially interpreted.
17;1967;"While mysticism and communism are not at all related at the practical level of Marxist political discussion and action, they show similarities at the level of their evaluation as cosmic philosophies. Dialectical materialism includes: (1) a rejection of mechanical materialism; (2) the affirmation that mental and spiritual qualities are irreducible to physics and chemistry; (3) the sense of the mystery of the world; (4) the Hegelian dialectic implying the unity and interconnection of all things as they are permeated by the One; (5) the fact that even Marx and Engels mentioned mystics among their precursors; (6) the appreciation of the evolutionary mysticism of Teilhard de Chardin by Marxists."
18;1968;A central technical problem in any historical sociological study of secularization has been the availability of quantifiable data of a kind at least somewhat comparable to those gathered by survey researchers. An effort is made here to determine the internal and external validity of the laity/clergy ratio as an indicator of secularization. The empirical focus is upon the Norwegian clergy between 1800 and 1950.
19;1968;"A longitudinal study of 96 graduates of the Dartmouth College class of 1940 raises the question, ""Do men who attend church regularly differ from men who do not?"" Although the group was homogeneous in many respects, certain striking differences emerge between the 59 church attenders and the 37 nonattenders. The nonattenders are reliably different in evincing greater creativeness. More nonattenders are in the professions. They are less likely to vote Republican than are the attenders. Significant differences are found in favor of nonattenders in the number of books read per year, and in their scores on the Scholastic Aptitude Test taken in the freshman year and on the Graduate Record Examination taken in the senior year. No significant differences were found between attenders and nonattenders on scales of self-development and value-energy. A measure of religious impulse is proposed. Only 16 per cent are considered to be animated by a religious impulse. Proportionately, just as many men among the nonattenders are religious as among the attenders. This group, whether attenders or nonattenders, have much in common in their personality structure."
20;1968;"A more or less exhaustive set of reasons for participating in religious activities was identified by respondents from a wide variety of religious denominations. These reasons were cast into a standard form and presented as a Q-sort to 100 undergraduates who rated each reason's ""importance to me."" A principal components inverse factor analysis yielded seven interpretable clusters of people (types): the humble servants of God; the self-improvers; the family guidance seekers; the moralists; the God-seekers; the socially-oriented servants of God; the religious eggheads. These clusters correspond to dimensions found in other studies. Degree of membership in clusters related meaningfully to personal, social and demographic variables."
21;1968;Explanations for the spread of a modern religious movement are sought within the dynamics of the movement itself. Five key factors are identified and functionally analysed: (1) an acephalous, reticulate organizational structure, (2) face-to-face recruitment along lines of pre-existing significant social relationships, (3) commitment generated through an act or experience, (4) change-oriented ideology, and (5) real or perceived opposition. It is suggested that these five factors are common in other types of movements and that when they are present and interacting, the conditions which were causal in the genesis of the movement become facilitating only and are not essential to its spread.
22;1968;"In contrast to the peculiarly fluctuating Western relationship of religious and political powers, continuously in conflict with each other, the Russian religious structures consistently follow the more common pattern of monistic unity and are characterized by total subordination to the political system. The contrasting structural characteristics warrant a conceptual dichotomy in which dependency and independency of the religious structures occupy opposing ends of a typological scale. Challenging the fashionable view, which leads to the neglect of the cultural context of societal actions, this paper emphasizes the crucial impact of the cultural context in which a particular church-state relationship occurs. The early and unstable Western dualism exploded eventually into various, more or less imperfect pluralistic solutions; while in the foreseeable Russian future any dualistic or pluralistic diffusion of power is highly improbable."
23;1968;Observations of group life in America have led students of assimilation to argue that large numbers of people continue to interact mainly along religious lines even though their cultural differences are minor. Gordon has hypothesized that many intellectuals, among whom academics are numerically the most important group, are not oriented toward the religious group in interaction or identification, but instead live in a milieu largely free of such structural cleavages. This hypothesis was put to test on samples of Protestant and Mormon academics and non-academics. Results were in support of the hypothesis. Academics with Protestant backgrounds in the humanities and social sciences were in particular weak in religious communality.
24;1968;"One way of investigating the functions of theological doctrines is to compare them with scientific theories as ways of interpreting experience. Ian Ramsey has treated a number of themes relevant to this comparison, including the use of models in science and theology and the role of paradox in the latter. Ramsey holds that paradoxes are to be dissolved by tracing them back to distinct models, each revealed in and justified by ""disclosure."" It is here argued that this interpretation is inadequate when the experience-interpreting function of theology is considered, but can consistently be supplemented with an interpretation which treats paradoxes as based on models which are complementary in the wave-particle sense."
25;1968;"Our galloping 20th Century Revolutions of Science and Technoculture have deep roots in the Protestant Reformations and the Revolutions in Science and Philosophy of the 16th and 17th Centuries. These decisive recastings of the relations of conscience--moral, religious, scientific--and character need to be seen in wider frames than those adopted by Max Weber in his renowned ""Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism"" (1904-05). To do justice to these developments, we have to go beyond Weber in the spirit of his last essays before his death in 1920. New stress has to be given to the role of the revolutions of organized systems of ""rationales"" both of action and thought within the processes Weber described under the heading of ""Rationalizations."" The breakthroughs to the modern world and the propulsive developments now in progress have less to do with the ""spirit of capitalism"" and the ""profit motive"" in their narrow senses than to the runaway effects of the dynamic fusions of the by-products, not always hoped for, of two complex movements: The Protestant Reformation (and its bearings in respect of the newer orientations toward self, society, and the city of this world) and, The Scientific Revolution (and its consequences in the way of a development of an Universal symbolic mathematical science and technology). These fusions occurred at great heats toward the close of the 19th Century in Europe and the United States and are now at ""the exponential growth point."" Both of these movements began as fundamental critiques of the medieval integrated institutiion of ""Conscience-Casuistry-and the Cure of Souls."" In brief: The twofold changes in the fundamental ""Moralities of Thought"" and ""Logics of Action"" embraced in the earlier institution of conscience constitute the necessary foundations of the accelerated passage now in progress towards the universal automation of collective intelligence in the form of ""Brain Machines"" and ""Memory Banks."""
26;1968;"Previous studies have identified several dimensions reflecting the concepts used by religious people in describing God. Semantic Differential research has also found adjectival factors which apply to numerous concepts, including that of God. The present study sought to identify replicable factors in the conceptualization of the deity from both areas of previous research. Adjectives of possible applicability to the concept of ""God"" were included in a hierarchical factor analysis. A general factor of the Traditional Christian concept appeared along with factors previously identified (Deisticness, Eternality, Evaluation, Kindliness, Omni-ness, and Wrathfulness) as well as several new dimensions (e.g., Irrelevancy and Potently Passive). The internal consistency of each scale resulting from the factor analysis was determined in another sample of subjects and indicated that most of the factors could be easily measured."
27;1968;The career of Orestes Brownson, who roamed from church to church during his adult life, provides rich data for the study of religious affiliation. We suggest that the need to affiliate with religious groups can be best understood by noting how related personal and social factors interact to influence affiliation behavior. Thus Brownson relied on his religious affiliations to reverse the disrupting effects of his personal lack of parental guidance in a social climate of confusing religious controversy. His Catholic conversion was the direct result of the tendency of his Protestant affiliations to intensify rather than mitigate these early frustrations.
28;1968;"The distance from a purely quantitative statement of a statistical pattern to a sociological interpretation of that pattern is often quite great. Several steps are sometimes needed to cover that distance. With regard to the interpretation of interfaith marriage statistics, a third refinement is suggested here to add to two previously developed refinements. These should be seen as steps toward greater reliability of measurement; but they still leave us with a definition of intermarriage that fails to take the full range of personality and structural aspects into account. A thorough revision of our conceptions of interfaith marriage is called for."
29;1968;The hypothesis is tested that in special conditions religious beliefs can function as a stablizing force on personal and social systems. The sample was drawn from an urban hospital population, using criteria that produced a largely low-income sample of mothers. The data show that under the conditions of heightened psycho-situational stress and limited resources for adaptation, mothers who located causality of illness in God, in contrast to those who viewed illness as naturalistically determined, were more likely to report a marginal rather than a difficult or a smooth adaptation to family disruptions during illness. Theoretical implications of these findings are discussed.
30;1968;"The primary purpose of this study was to investigate the construct validity of the Religious scale of the Allport-Vernon-Lindzey Study of Values (SV R scale). The SV and a slightly modified form of the Aspects of Religious Belief Questionnaire (ARBQ) (Allport, Gillespie, & Young, 1948) were administered to 378 freshmen students, 60% of whom were male. Items from the SV R scale and from the ARBQ were intercorrelated and the resulting matrix reduced to five factors which accounted for 92% of the SV R score variance. In partial disagreement with the SV manual, results suggest that the R scale indicates an activist who approaches religion intellectually and rationally, generally endorses traditional forms of Christian institutions, and seeks to apply religious principles in daily life. The interpretation of each factor and its relation to Allport's ""extrinsic-intrinsic"" dimension of religion is discussed. Reinterpretations of representative studies and implications of these revisions for studies in areas outlined by the SV manual are presented."
31;1968;The way in which a concept is defined strongly influences its use in research. There are times when drastic redefinition can open up new questions and powerfully affect our approaches to old questions. Definition of interfaith marriage on the basis of the single criterion of church membership or identification, it is argued, has prevented us from studying the causes and consequences of intermarriage effectively. A multi-variable definition is proposed and its possible effects on research are illustrated.
32;1968;This paper offers a typology of organized religion that grows out of the conceptions of the Ultimate espoused by Christian religious bodies and relates to these conceptions the patterns of social organization of these bodies. The attempt is to discover a typology that adequately accommodates the theological and confessional character of religious bodies, on one hand, and their social structures and behavioral patterns, on the other. The paper offers three major types: Familial, Democratic, and Dominical.
33;1968;This paper, working from a twofold typology of religious and ecclesiastical reform, proposes a thesis which holds that religious reform proceeds at its own pace and constitutes the change to which the Church ultimately must adapt if it is to survive as a structure. Changes in norms, values, life goals, and core ritual constitute religious reform. Some of the norms undergoing change concern contraception, obligatory Mass attendance and unquestioning priestly obedience. The once high value placed on the priesthood shows evidence of diminution, while the Mass, the core ritual of Catholicism and traditionally its own raison d'être, shows evidence of becoming a function of community or fellowship. These changes generate conflict with ecclesiastical authority which seeks orderly growth, internal discipline, and the avoidance of conflict. Assuming the beneficial or integrative function of social conflict, a new, humane, and religious synthesis of values and goals may be expected to emerge (provided the religious reformers do not tire of conflict). On the new synthesis, the thesis holds, will rest the new forms of religious life, encompassing both Protestant and Catholic.
34;1968;"Those who study religion scientifically have tended to ignore a category of religious phenomenon which appears to be of significance and an understanding of which provides a more complete understanding of religious behavior. That category is the religious ""nones."" This article (1) calls attention to this neglect; (2) discusses some of the implications of the use of the ""none"" label; (3) explores some evidence of the relationship between nonaffiliation and a) other religious variables such as beliefs, religious experience, and participation in religious meetings and rituals and b) other social behavior; and (4) explores some methodological and theoretical considerations arising from this analysis. On the basis of this evidence, it is suggested that the religious ""none"" or independent is a phenomenon worthy of study."
35;1969;At present there are two social movements engaged in efforts to alter the power structure of the United States, a Black Power movement and a Church Power movement. Both aim either to revolutionize or to diminish the power of a democratic majority in an affluent democratic society. The Church Power movement seeks to revolutionize middle-class America. The Black Power movement has the alternative of Black Nationalism.
36;1969;"Data, describing and analyzing the anomalous role of the Mexican Mayo Indian ritual impersonator are utilized to evaluate four explanations of ritual impersonation: historical, psychological-affective, sociological, and cultural-cognitive. The cultural-cognitive explanation interprets the fact that ?apakobam protect the customs while at the same time they are burlesquing them. They ""know no shame"" yet they ""confess on behalf of the community."" This anomalous role of ?apakoba mediates numerous other oppositions: human-animal, living-dead, male-female, child-adult, health-sickness. The conflicting portrayal of opposing themes creates cognitive dissonance which enhances the final traditional solution when it is presented. Through the role of ritual impersonator, numerous oppositions and conflicts within the structure of culture and society are ritually mediated, ritual learning takes place, and individuals better understand and more deeply identify with their cultures and societies."
37;1969;"Eastern mystical movements operating in America recruit partly from young persons who have previously experimented with psychedelic drugs. This paper argues that these cults serve as a ""half-way house"" between the drug culture and reassimilation into conventional society. Since mystical experiences share elements with drug sensations, the former can operate as a substitute gratification for the latter and facilitate the termination of drug taking. Since mystical ""trips"" are less legally precarious and less physically incapacitating than drug ""trips,"" the changeover from drugs to non-chemical mysticism tends to facilitate further adjustments in the direction of adopting conventional routinized life-styles. This analysis is exemplified by a case study of the Meher Baba cult which recruits from the drug culture. The writings of Meher Baba contain some elements which are congruent with the ""psychedelic"" emphasis on inner exploration and other elements which provide linkages with conventional norms. Baba followers tend to shift their emphasis from the passive-contemplative to the active-service oriented aspects of Baba's teachings as their drug experiences recede into the past. Socialization from the drug culture via Baba into conventional life-styles is thus a gradual process without sharp discontinuities."
38;1969;Glossolalia tape-recorded from four groups--English- and Spanish-speaking--showed characteristics common to all groups. It is a noncommunicative behavior of vocalization. Although the phonetic inventory and the grouping of sounds vary somewhat from group to group, these are stereotyped within the group and rigidly adhered to. An analysis of the phonology, accent pattern, and intonation shows the individual utterance to have a threshold of onset, a brief rising gradient of intensity, a peak, and a final, often precipitous decay. This paper proposes that this agreement, despite cultural diversity and difference in language, exists because glossolalia is an artifact of a dissociative state termed trance. A brief characterization of the role of this little researched state is attempted on the basis of field experiences, and a comparison with similar manifestations in other areas.
39;1969;"If one adopts a definition of religion that emphasizes its function, as in coping with chaos or in expressing ultimate concern (rather than the forms which serve such functions in one system or another), the more crucial measurement question becomes ""How is a person religious?"" rather than ""How religious is he?"" Following the analogy of structural linguistics or of natural history, an exploratory effort was made, with open-ended, non-doctrinal questions to tap the natural expression of ultimate concern among a college sample. Students did indicate overwhelmingly their inclinations to pursue basic, permanent questions. Those most expressing such concerns were most likely to belong to groups formed to address such concerns."
40;1969;In the static culture of the southern regions of the United States, soldier saints became the character model by which the moral problem of violence was met. From 1830 to 1930, the South venerated soldiers of evangelical piety who embodied the ideals of identity and definiteness, fidelity and steadfastness, self-restraint and serenity.
41;1969;Religious patterns of conversion are shown to differ depending upon whether the spouse was a Catholic or a Protestant, a wife or a husband. Patterns of conversion were mediated to some extent by the social status of the husband as suggested by the occupation of the husband. The decision to convert or not to convert involves a confrontation between two religious systems, and it may also represent a clash between religious constraints and non-religious constraints.
42;1969;Roman Catholic convents are compared with villages and cities (vills), with prisons, and with formal organizations. Interview data are provided for a Trappist monastery and a teaching convent. These systems are distinguished sharply both from prisons (especially in the lack of force) and vills (particularly in the absence of biosocial families). On a more general level, the monastic convent is a communal organization, sharing traits with other systems related to vills, whereas the apostolic convent is a formal organization emphasizing specific goals. However, it is suggested that all convents have communal traits in that religious ends may be inherently non-specific and thus non-formal.
43;1969;Russian Marxism has been called a religion, or compatible with religion, by many laymen as well as theologians. This paper attempts to find acceptable definitions of religion and of Russian Marxism, and goes on to show that, in terms of these, Russian Marxism, on the one hand can be called a religion and, on the other, is totally opposed to religion in all acceptable forms. It finds further that Russian Marxism is, in fact, an inversion of Christianity and, more specifically, of Roman Catholicism. It concludes that because of the diametrically opposed views of Christianity and Russian Marxism, a Christian-Russian Marxist dialogue is impossible, if each side is to retain its essential nature.
44;1969;The concept of God, as it has come down to us in the Hebrew-Christian tradition, suffers from insurmountable difficulties. This concept emerged not only in response to a religious need, but also to satisfy some strictly philosophical, cognitive aspirations. Unfortunately, the four basic components of this concept are logically incompatible, and this logical incompatibility lies behind the puzzles and the paradoxes which have plagued Christian theology since its inception.
45;1969;The grouping together of Holiness and Pentecostal religion for purposes of sociological analysis is not justified. Despite the common theological base and forms of anti-worldliness which they share, Pentecostalism and Holiness religion are distinguishable from one another in terms of the types of religious experience they emphasize. Considerable differences are found in the extent to which their doctrines are distinctive, their organizations exclusive, their meetings inspirational, and their following from the lowest social strata. These differences suggest a greater tendency for Pentecostalism than for Holiness movements to generate sects. The differences are attributed primarily to the highly subjective and invisible nature of Holiness religious experience which has few implications for separatism and enables many Holiness movements to remain interdenominational.
46;1969;The need for a refined concept of cult emerged as the result of an attempt to analyse the Spiritualist movement in terms of the church-sect typology. Previous definitions of cult also appear inadequate when applied to the analysis of Spiritualism. This paper argues the need for a refined concept of cult, and proposes a definition of cult in terms of one basic criterion--that cults are religious movements which make a fundamental break with the religious tradition of the culture--and two subordinate criteria--that cults are composed of individuals who have had or seek mystical, psychic, or ecstatic experiences, and that they are concerned with the problems of individuals. It also proposes a typology of cults, and an explanation of the origin and development of cults in terms of a continuum from cult to new religion.
47;1969;"The Ramakrishna movement, beginning in nineteenth century India, and represented today by many schools, hospitals, publishing houses, and missions, is analyzed as an example of a modern religious movement. Among the factors examined are the influence of Ramakrishna's personality in supplying the passional and charismatic underpinnings of the movement, the role of westernizing supporters, the relationship of Ramakrishna to his disciples, and the process by which hero-worship was replaced by a service-orientation. The general thesis is that the Ramakrishna movement owed much of its strength initially to its striking fusion of an archaic, traditionalist rhetoric with a ""modern"" set of meliorative goals."
48;1969;The Rastafari cult in Jamaica is a predominantly male-oriented politico-religious protest cult involving the Messianic worship of the Emperor Haille Salassie, and anticipating its return to Africa. This detailed anthropological study of the Rastafari movement interprets the data on the institution itself, and the associated symbol system, in sociological and psychoanalytic terms, and demonstrates how the cult is based on a self-renewing and self-justifying system of belief and action.
49;1969;The sudden and dramatic religious conversion experience of a male divinity student is presented and explored in terms of its role in adolescent development. Particular emphasis is placed on his perception of family relationships, and especially on how the conversion experience serves to alter a perception of the actual father as weak, ineffective, or absent by supplying instead an internal representation of a strong and principled substitute paternal figure with clear values and firm judgments. This representation of a positive and powerful paternal figure is seen as crucial in aiding the adolescent process of individuation and differentiation by countering strong longings to retain or reestablish a sense of undifferentiated union with the maternal figure.
50;1969;"The theory of functional-structural differentiation has been proposed as an explanation of such characteristics of American religious institutions as separation of church and state, denominationalism, voluntarism and privatism in religion. After considering certain formal problems of this theory the author derives three testable hypotheses from it. If differentiation has taken place, then in comparison with the past, contemporary American religious institutions (1) should be more preoccupied with the core goal-attainment functions of religion; (2) should possess a clearer institutional identity; (3) should have a more narrow conception of the minister's role. Using data from American church history and studies of contemporary American religion the author summarizes evidence contra these hypotheses. While contemporary religious institutions may be labeled as structurally differentiated, i.e., voluntary associations, they have more rather than fewer secondary functions than in the past, less a sense of special identity and a profusion of ministers' activities. A new model of differentiation as a process is necessary."
51;1969;The thesis of this paper is that fourteenth century German mystics administered psychotherapy to fourteenth century German merchants, thereby aiding the efforts of the merchants to rationalize commerce and society. The argument runs that the merchants' emphasis on economic rationalism violated traditional values of the Church and of medieval society in general. Since the Church and the associated social order were perceived as controlling every man's chances for salvation, the merchants felt anxious and guilty about their rationalist tendencies, and were therefore tempted to dilute them. Another solution, however, was to continue the rationalism but to seek therapy for the anxiety and guilt that it evoked. Mysticmonks were among those who provided such therapy. Analyses and speculations are offered regarding the symbolism that goaded the therapy forward.
52;1969;"Theoretical discussions of religion's integrative potential are empirically tested with survey data collected from a sample of 609 respondents. Integration is measured with morale, Srole's anomia, and various alienation scales. Product-moment correlations show that participation in secular organizations is more highly associated with socio-psychological integration than is participation in church services. In order to test Robert Bellah's ""superordinate meaning system"" hypothesis the data are elaborated by intensity of orthodox religious belief (as measured with the McClosky scale). The relationship between secular participation and integration is doubled under the high belief, high church participation condition and reduced almost to zero under the low belief, low participation condition. It is concluded that religious belief acts as a superordinate meaning system capable of endowing secular activity with greater and more integrative meaning."
53;1969;Theories which explain glossolalia as indicative of psychological pathology, suggestibility, or hypnosis, or as a result of social disorganization and deprivation are reviewed and found inadequate to explain recent data on the Pentecostal movement. Concepts of glossolalia as learned behavior and as part of a process of personality reorganization are found more useful. Data are presented to support a functional interpretation of glossolalia as one component in the process of commitment to a movement with important implications for both personal and social change.
54;1969;This paper attempts to develop a testable theory of secularization. The first requirement of this theory is to specify the limitations of structural-functional analysis. One of these limitations is its adherence to questionable norms for the measurement of religion. In moving beyond structural-functional analysis of secularization as a process, the choice is made to define the secular in terms of Parsons's theory of action. This theory suggests the possibility of a secular, as well as a religious normative orientation. These two normative orientations contain such dimensions as scope, intensity, and a posture toward social change. The theoretical development of this paper is related to major analyses of American society and calls into question some of the assumptions underlying the theory of action.
55;1969;This paper examines the sustained attempt by Félicité Lamennais to solve the perennial ethical problem of the rapport between liberty and authority. An early apostle of the Romantic reaction of the early 19th century, Lamennais, in his deep-seated yearning for the harmony and religious unity of the medieval world, sought to reconstruct the principle of authority in religion, and, therefore, in society on a broad philosophical base. Using this same philosophical groundwork, he later emerged as a champion of the modern liberties evolving out of the rise of liberalism and the French Revolution. How did such a remarkable transition from theocratic authoritarianism to Catholic liberalism take place? Such themes as tolerance, religion, society, authority, liberty, and history--inter-related elements of political reality--are pieces of the mosaic which Félicité Lamennais labored to bring into being as a major synthesis of theology and philosophy. The originality and the magnitude of the Mennaisian effort had a powerful impact on the subsequent history of Roman Catholicism. The fundamental question of social coexistence, heading in turn to a basically metaphysical reflection upon the nature and sources of society and social being, was the basic issue for Lamennais. The crucial and very contemporary character of the question of unity and plurality within the modern world makes it quite evident that a constant study of the problem, its historical development, and ultimate implications, is readily justifiable and worthwhile.
56;1969;This research investigates the relation between images of parents and of God, with special attention to the difference between maternal and paternal characteristics. Subjects rated each of their parents and God on eighteen maternal and eighteen paternal characteristics. Subjects were selected to permit comparisons between sexes, different ages, and different fields of study. Data presented here are drawn from United States samples, but comparisons are also made with previously reported results from Belgium samples. In all samples, the image of God is more paternal than maternal. In the American samples, unlike the Belgian, God appears to become gradually more maternal. American females and males both emphasize the paternal qualities of God (the males somewhat more so), unlike the French speaking Belgian sample who emphasize the parental qualities corresponding to their own sex. In the American sample, specialized field of study does not appear related to the God concept, unlike the Belgian among whom scientific students conceive of God more maternally and literary students more paternally. (In the American sample, liberal arts students do report a more maternal mother and a less paternal father than science students.
57;1970;A 54-item multiple-choice test was developed to measure the cognitive component of attitude toward one specific concept of church. Validity and reliability were established. The rationale for the test is based on the need for multidimensional measurement, and the result is a scale which demonstrates how to delineate and measure one carefully defined referent. The scale illustrates a marked psychometric advance over the conceptually vague and undifferentiated Chave-like scale, but is not yet refined by factor analysis.
58;1970;"A clergyman's views on God, church, and world are related to the orientation of his ministry. The data indicate that clergy involvement with social problems, such as that exhibited by the ""new breed"" of American clergy, is linked to views on how to fulfill obligations to God in the secular realm; to beliefs about the role of the church in obstructing change; and to conceptions of the proper tactics and objectives of social reform efforts. Clergy views on man's finiteness and sinfulness in the eyes of God are not related to the degree of involvement with social problems."
59;1970;"A comparative analysis of the sociological theories of religion of Saint-Simon, Comte, Proudhon, and Marx reveals that, although they agreed that the traditional institutions of Christianity had outlived their utility to society, their writings differ radically in the delineation of the specific role of religion in industrial society. Saint-Simon and Comte attempted to create a secular religion of humanity, based in the case of Saint-Simon on fraternity and technocracy; in the writings of Comte, on positivism and industry. Proudhon and Marx discarded both religion and humanism as false ideologies; Proudhon substituted the gospel of anarchism, Marx that of socialism. These diverse positions mask a common recognition of the social nature of religion. Implications of their ideas for contemporary research are examined with reference to the underlying postulates of representation, unity and integration, social control, alienation, relativism, and social change. Their recognition of the need to develop viable alternatives to the traditional religions is highly pertinent to the contemporary quest for solutions to the problem of secularization."
60;1970;A measure of religiosity was developed, based on subjects' associations to 80 consonant-vowel-consonant groups, which had previously been scaled for religious association value. Subjects were not given ambiguous instructions intended to measure how many religious associations might spontaneously emerge. Rather, subjects were specifically instructed to form religious associations, if they could, and to use the association in a complete sentence. The distinction is based on that made by Wallace between dispositional and capability conceptions of personality. Responses could be reliably scored on a three-point scale of religiosity. Sex differences in the expected direction provide a preliminary suggestion of validity.
61;1970;"Although the crucial importance of relativism in modern religious consciousness has been acknowledged by many sociologists of religion, few studies have attempted to operationalize the term and to empirically test the effect of relativism on ordinary indices of religious behavior. In a questionnaire survey of religious attitudes in a New England suburb, this study undertook (1) An operational definition of relativism; (2) a description of the pervasiveness of relativism among the laity sampled; and (3) an investigation of the relationship between relativism and some indices of institutional religious practice. Relativism was found to be widespread and only weakly related to the rejection of orthodox beliefs and practices of devotion, a lack of interest in religious questions, and to a lack of participation in church ritual and club membership. Perhaps relativism and commitment to a particular religious tradition need not represent mutually exclusive tendencies."
62;1970;Among a small sample of Swedish theology students, those planning to enter the priesthood were found more open to pictures of death than those planning to enter other professions.
63;1970;An operationalized measure of religious experience, the Religious Experience Episodes Measure (REEM), was constructed and demonstrated to differentiate persons reliably according to degree of reported religious experience. Further research was concerned with the empirical relationship between the REEM and religious orientation as measured by Allport's Religious Orientation Scale. It was demonstrated that intrinsically religious oriented persons were more likely to report having had a religious experience than were extrinsically religious oriented persons. The lack of a significant difference in reported religious experiences between intrinsically religious oriented persons and indiscriminately pro-religious oriented persons is discussed from a methodological perspective as is the lack of significant difference between extrinsically oriented persons and indiscriminately anti-religious oriented persons in reported religious experiences. The possibility of empirically interrelating measures of religious experience, religious orientation, and secular activities is briefly discussed.
64;1970;Analyses of the fundamentalist-modernist controversies and of church-sect typologies suggest that the theological position of religious institutions may be viewed sociologically as an independent variable which is common to both theoretical orientations. A study of sixty-six Protestant churches in a midwestern American city reveals interesting relationships between self-classified theological position and several institutional characteristics. These data point to the conclusion that theological position is a useful indicator of many important institutional characteristics and may be a key variable for locating religious bodies on the multidimensional church-sect continuum.
65;1970;"Based on a questionnaire study of 405 students at three eastern colleges, it is shown that religious membership and religious preference are not interchangeable indices. As a consequence of using one or the other, the size and composition of the ""no religion"" group are affected. The two indicators relate differently to other measures of religiosity and to a social attitude. Preference is correlated with pacifism, while membership is not. It is suggested that the wording of questions regarding religious affiliation is crucial."
66;1970;"Based on the sociological tradition since Weber, religious commitment is seen to enhance both autonomy from secular constraint and also better adjustment to the secular environment. This interpretation is applied to a group of Japanese Americans in Hawaii who were converted to a deviant sect introduced from Japan. Three characteristics of Japanese Americans--responsiveness to social sanction, striving for success, and rigidity--are changed in bipolar directions through conversion. On the one hand the convert is shown to have overcome his old cultural constraint through ""de-culturation,"" and, on the other, to have rechanneled the same orientations for ""re-socialization"" in the multi-cultural setting of Hawaii. Conversion is thus interpreted as a trigger for releasing a wider range of behavioral options suited for transcultural environment."
67;1970;Black Muslim leaders appear to have been influenced in the early 1930s by eschatalogical teachings of the Jehovah's Witnesses. Several details of doctrine are too similar to be coincidental. There is some evidence of direct contact between the two groups. It is possible that the cryptic ambiguity of the Watchtower doctrines enhanced their appeal to the Black Muslims.
68;1970;"Improved conceptualization of interreligious marriage and greater precision of terminology are steps toward improved theories of intermarriage. In a sociological conceptual framework, interreligious marriage is one type of interaction between religious groups, subsocieties, or societies that are under constraint not to mingle on an intimate basis because of differences in values. Interreligious marriage threatens values, security, and continuity of a religion, and is held in check by an endogamous eligibility system that extends to the incorporation of children of intermarried couples into one or the other religion. Internally, intensity of endogamy is related to the degree of independence of the religious group from the larger society. Relationships between religious societies are conceptualized as in-group/out-group relationships. Analysis of interreligious marriage has often been inexact due to limitations of data to coarse categories of religion, such as Jewish, Catholic, and Protestant; to the failure to go beyond formal church affiliations of members in search of their degree of religiosity; and to inexact use of certain terms, such as intermarriage, endogamy, exogamy, homogamy, and heterogamy."
69;1970;"Individuals affected by a rapidly changing or disorganized society are constrained to adapt in some manner. Two modes of adaptation are indicated by tendencies toward joining authoritarian organizations and sectarian churches. The first is an attempt to regain and preserve an interaction pattern perceived as threatened; the second represents retreat from a society which is perceived to be disorderly and threatening. If alienation is on the rise, the importance of such groups in complex societies may increase. Data presented in this paper indicate that powerlessness and authoritarianism are related to tendencies toward joining both authoritarian organizations and sectarian churches. Anomia is positively related with attitude toward sectarian churches, but negatively related with attitude toward authoritarian organizations. The findings contribute to knowledge of the motivation toward joining these kinds of organizations and also support the notion that alienation is a multi-dimensional phenomenon."
70;1970;"John Henry Newman's experience of prolonged, intense conflict regarding the ministry as a career provides rich data for the study of vocational identity. This discussion stresses the influence of both personal experience and social factors in this conflict. His misgivings regarding the ministry are traced to his father's influence toward a ""secular"" career and to the declining prestige of the ministry in early nineteenth-century England. His attraction to the ministry is traced to his grandmother's strong confirmation of his ""call"" to an extraordinary religious career and to the instability of contemporary English life which led him to seek security in the church."
71;1970;"Sixty-eight Catholic priests requested the resignation of the archbishop of the San Antonio, Texas archdiocese in 1968. Their dissidence involved a significant confrontation with church authority. In interviews the dissidents expressed ""liberal"" attitudes in regard to authority, on theological matters, and on racial and ethnic minorities. Outlines of a ""psychotherapeutic ethic"" are discernible in their orientation to man and society. This orientation clarifies and is clarified by their self-images as derived from the Twenty Statements Test (TST), a device developed in G. H. Mead's tradition. The psychotherapeutic ethic needs close scrutiny. The particular dissidence of the priests suggests larger questions about dissidents. The possible emergence of a special personality type is also suggested."
72;1970;"Social transfers of scarce values are accomplished by exchange, by coercion, and by giving. Religiously sanctioned sharing (alms-giving, donations, bequests, or ""charity"") appears to exist in most and perhaps all societies. Encouragement, injunctions, and imperatives concerning giving are very frequent in religious systems, and acts of benevolence often are invested with profound religious significance and value. But ""giving"" is also a widespread social pattern in contexts which can hardly be called religious. Accordingly, we begin with two central questions: (1) Why and how do social units (individuals or collectivities) transfer scarce and valuable rights? (2) Of those transfers which we classify as giving, what is the part played in the total pattern by religious beliefs, values and symbols, and how is giving linked to the basic character of the environing society? A selective sketch of these complex problems is given here."
73;1970;"Sociometry is used to identify and study social relationships and group formations within an inclusive sample of Protestant ministers (N = 39) in a medium-size city. Analysis of sociometric tests reveals that ministers form homogenous cliques, based on both theological beliefs and political attitudes, and that certain ministers within cliques are differentiated into ""star"" status and ""isolate"" status. It is suggested that the neglected study of social groups and social structure in sociology of religion research may begin to be corrected by the use of sociometry."
74;1970;"The moral basis of advanced societies is the group basis of advanced societies. That was Durkheim's essential insight and enduring contribution to the sociology of the moral order. He asked, in effect: (1) What is the basis of association or group formation which engenders moral rules? (2) What units of societal organization comprise ""moral communities"" on this basis? and (3) What ethos or ethical system formulates and regulates these relationships? The classic replies given in On the Division of Labor in Society and subsequent works--the division of labor, occupational associations, and professional ethics--are analyzed for conceptual adequacy and tested for empirical relevance. Although the diagnosis and prescription Durkheim offered are found to be deficient in crucial respects, nevertheless they provide strategic points of departure in the quest for values and the quest for community."
75;1970;Two measures of religious belief were found correlated with dogmatism, not with repression-sensitization, in a sample of Georgia State University students.
76;1970;Using the Rokeach Dogmatism Scale on a sample of Catholic clergy and ex-clergy, this study finds that both priests in the active ministry and seminarians are significantly more dogmatic than either ex-priests or ex-seminarians. The difference in dogmatism between clergymen who persevere in their clerical role and those who leave the ministry is interpreted both in terms of organizational self-selection and of personality differences between the groups.
77;1971;"A 1959 study of suburban attitudes toward open housing demonstrated the typical findings of relationship between church-going and prejudice: church members were more prejudiced than non-members, and moderate attenders were more prejudiced than either frequent or slight attenders. A six-year follow-up, after vigorous efforts by clergy and others in the community to counteract prejudice among church-goers, yielded substantially different results: church members were less prejudiced than non-members, and moderate attenders were the least prejudiced. Evidence of the ""Myrdal dilemma"" remained: large percentages still regard segregation as unChristian or undemocratic, but oppose open housing."
78;1971;"Allport's concept of intrinsic-extrinsic (I-E) orientation to religion has stimulated useful theoretical and empirical work. Critical review of selected articles and original data were used to assess the concept's research utility. Conclusions: I-E has not been operationally defined as one bipolar continuum; it contains several component variables. I and E are not opposites. E is well operationalized as a selfish, instrumental approach to religion; I has not been operationally defined. These general labels, and ideas, should be abandoned in favor of attempts to define more specific components. The central phenomena involved may be pervasive personality variables, affecting ""secular"" as well as ""religious"" behavior."
79;1971;"Alvin Plantinga argues in ""God and Other Minds"" that it is rational to believe God exists because the teleological argument strongly resembles the analogical argument used to justify our belief that others have minds. His argument fails because of a disanalogy between the two arguments. One who uses the analogical argument cannot deny that a person who acts as they do has a mind. But a person who uses the teleological argument can deny that God exists while admitting that the universe is designed if they believe the existence of evil is incompatible with the existence of God. Analogical arguers consider only factors relevant to the analogical argument while theists must assert many propositions, such as ""evil is justified"" and ""exactly one Being designed the universe,"" which are not relevant to the teleological argument. Since atheists need only deny one of the many propositions theists must assert, it is reasonable to believe that God does not exist."
80;1971;"An analysis of unpublished details upon religious preference of married couples, collected in the March 1957 ""Current Population Survey"" by the United States Bureau of the Census, reveals a considerable interdenominational mixture of Protestants and a wide variation in the resort to intermarriage for the several religious groups."
81;1971;"College students' religious background and frequency of religious participation were related to scores on Rotter's ""locus of control"" scale, a measure designed to assess the tendency either to see oneself as having control over his reinforcements (internal control) or to see outside forces, such as luck or fate, as determining his outcomes (external control). There was a general tendency for people who participated more frequently in religious activities to express more internal attitudes. The relationship was mediated by sex, however; the effect was apparent only for females. Protestants were significantly more internal than Jews; Catholics scored between these two groups. Socio-economic status was not significantly related to locus of control in this sample."
82;1971;Education received by an immigrant in his native country is a factor of crucial importance for his occupational opportunities and overall adjustment in the new social environment, especially if he immigrates in his adult age. Therefore, the more uniform the education of members of an ethnic immigrant group or its segments, the greater the probability that their life chances in the adopted society will be, more or less, similar. Consequently, the differential achievements of various segments of an immigrant ethnic group may become the cause of latent intragroup conflicts, and result in factionalism in religious disputes along the lines of internal group differentiation. While such factionalism remains an intragroup affair on the manifest level, it may, on the latent level, be expressive of differential attitudes of the factions toward the larger society.
83;1971;Extrusion rates to public mental hospitals were studied as a function of the makeup of six different religions and denominations in a general population, and the comparative admission rates for respective affiliations. Roman Catholics and Baptists evidenced significantly higher proportions in the admissions population, with Methodists and Lutherans found to be significantly lower in their proportions admitted. Minority status in an exploratory study was also found to be a factor in extrusion to public mental hospitals. Results are interpreted in considering religion as both a precipitative condition and as a community mental health resource.
84;1971;"Four dimensions of variation in religious organizations are identified: bureaucratization, professionalization, integration, secularization. The religious organization is conceptualized as an open system within which structural arrangements are determined by structural compatibility, direction of external pressure, and exposure to external pressure. Bureaucratic structure is incompatible with professional structure; professional structure is compatible with integration and secularization, while bureaucratic structure is incompatible with those dimensions. Pressures toward bureaucratization and professionalization are located in denominations. Pressures toward integration and secularization are located in communities. Exposure to external pressures involves power-dependence relations (affecting denominational sources) and membership heterogeneity (affecting community sources)."
85;1971;"In an exploratory and descriptive approach to the career pattern concept, a sample of Southern Baptist pastors is analyzed according to various career mobility patterns. Weighted summary data reveal that about forty per cent are upwardly mobile and slightly more than one-fourth have stable mobility patterns; the remainder are roughly split between erratic mobility, downward mobility, and immobility. The patterns are analyzed according to congregation variables and personal characteristics of the pastors."
86;1971;It is proposed that previous studies of the relationship between orthodoxy and social activism have yielded inconsistent findings because a critical mediating variable, salience or perceived importance of religion, usually has been neglected. Findings from a survey of 1,300 students at Washington State University support the hypothesized role of salience as a mediating variable. Relationship between orthodoxy and church activism emerges only for the high salience subsamples. The apparent utility of the orthodoxy-salience-activism model for bringing coherence to previously inconsistent findings seems to argue for more widespread use of salience as a control variable in studies of the concomitants and consequences of religiosity.
87;1971;Questionnaires from 12,146 Unitarian Universalist members of eighty churches in a representative denominational sample were used to explore the dimensions of religiosity in a post-traditional religion. Mean scores by churches on forty-five varied items were factor-analyzed, producing a large first factor made up of theological values, institutional values, and personal moral values. The second dimension contained all items reflecting social morality. Other dimensions proposed are church sociality, psychological development emphasis, esthetic-worship values, religious education, church as a friendship source, and intrasectarian affirmations. On this basis, modifications of the dimensionality of religiosity are proposed.
88;1971;Religious organizations are far more likely to follow than to lead local community values because they are painfully vulnerable as organizations. They are dependent on members' favor for attendance, manpower, and financial support, whereas members participate largely for instrumental return. Clergy are likely to be predisposed to be passive and to be rewarded professionally largely for keeping their congregations satisfied. The national hierarchy has little basis for influencing the locally entrenched congregations.
89;1971;Sociologists continue to disagree on how to define the church-sect distinction. Some have expanded Troeltsch's historically based typology by adding new types based on a study of modern Christian bodies in the English-speaking nations. Others have tried to broaden the typology by defining it in terms of one or more analytical properties that can be applied to all religious bodies. There is little agreement on how the typology should be defined, but most sociologists do agree that a religious body's attitude toward its social environment should be a part of the definition. Some have argued that the typology serves no useful purpose, but in fact it has generated some useful theory concerning the process of sect development. The main shortcoming of this theory is its assumption that sect growth always leads to the compromising of religious purity and distinctiveness. It is rarely suggested that successful sects may have a strong impact on their environment. This assumption is reflected in the way sociologists treat churches and denominations, particularly in contemporary society. Sociologists are urged to abandon this assumption and to take a clearer look at how religious bodies actually adapt themselves to their environments.
90;1971;Stark and Glock, among others, argue that there is a general tendency in this country for persons to switch to denominations more liberal, theologically, than those of their parents. A closer look at their own data using a factor analytic technique, however, suggests that this hypothesis may be too simple. Denominational switching occurs essentially without reference to the liberal or conservative stance of the denominations involved, and changes of denomination are made in such a way as to preserve similarity along other dimensions. These other dimensions include a Protestant-Catholic cleavage, accessibility (in both the geographic and social status senses), and liturgy. No net intergenerational change in one direction or the other is observable along any of these dimensions. While switching does occur so as to maintain similarity along these dimensions, the direction of change along any one of them is essentially random.
91;1971;The concept of social distance is applied to interreligious marriage. Vertical and horizontal social distance are conceptualized to show that both are feasible concepts in relation to religion. A scale, based on work by Prince (1956), ranges from complete rejection of other religions (would neither date nor marry) through various conditions making marriage feasible, to assimilation through conversion into another religion to make marriage possible. The scale was used with Catholic, Jewish, and Protestant university students. The results are analyzed in the light of historical and current policies and experiences to demonstrate the validity of the scale. Choice of dating partners reflected the attitudes shown on the social distance scale. When choices outside the student's own religion were distributed according to the social distance scale they tended to be selected by students at the tolerant or low social distance end of the scale, showing some consistency between attitudes and behavior.
92;1971;"The construction of five separate scales to assess the ""dimensions"" of religiosity by Faulkner and DeJong suggests an independence among the scales which has not been demonstrated. A comparison of the average intrascale item correlations with the average interscale values indicates close correspondence among the Ritualistic, Experiential, Intellectual, and Ideological scales, with the Ideological emerging as the predominant one. In addition, the construction of a composite scale based on the 5-D scales more than adequately meets the minimum criteria of Guttman scaling. These data suggest some question as to the ""separateness"" of the 5-D scales."
93;1971;The influence of peers on religious behavior was studied by means of a field experiment. The subjects were seventh grade children. Frequency of daily Mass attendance was used as an unobtrusive behavioral measure of peer influence. Two experimental groups, in which peer confederates behaved in a compliant or non-compliant way, were compared with the behavior of a control group. Results show that boy leaders, chosen by their own classmates, had a significant effect on the behavior of girl students in the expected directions, but no significant effect on the behavior of other male classmates. Possible reasons for the differential effects on boys and girls are suggested.
94;1971;The preference between two factions in the religious schism of a Serbian Orthodox church was found to be highly correlated with preference between American political parties. The religiously dissenting group was found to be predominantly Republican in political preference. Although the religious dissent was interpreted as reflecting and protesting degradation in social status, this group apparently hoped for more relief through the anticommunist policies of the Republicans than through the social ameliorative policies of the Democrats.
95;1971;The present study utilized three age groups of volunteer male and female members of two large churches, one liberal and one conservative, of the same Protestant denomination. Subjects were assessed as to an intrinsic-extrinsic religious orientation, a belief in internal versus external control of reinforcement, and authoritarianism. Results suggest that church members identified as religiously intrinsic were significantly more likely to believe in internal control of reinforcement. Authoritarianism was not related to either religious orientation or locus of control. Relationships between the belief systems, age, sex, education, and church attendance were also discussed.
96;1971;The psychologists' extrinsic-intrinsic distinction and the sociologists' church-sect typology have similar origins and similar characteristics. Both were developed as tools of analysis in the service of prophet-like concern for the purity and the social efficacy of religion. Both reflect their originators' philosophical struggle with the relation between the historical and the transcendent. The formal properties of both types, though notoriously unsuited for many of the scientific tasks to which they have subsequently been assigned, are admirably suited to express these concerns that first evoked them.
97;1971;"The question of human freedom or free choice--more or less laid in classical Christian theology and modern physical science--asserts itself today primarily through the claims of modern psychological theory. The question of being basically free or unfree turns upon the access that a person has to his own unconscious motivations, i.e., to his own psychic set. It is the intent of this paper to argue that this set, which dominates all critical choices, is itself subject to change through ""the converting choice""; thus giving man final control over his own character and over the truly important choices that he occasionally is called upon to make."
98;1971;The religious experience of Christians was viewed as an interpersonal relationship between believers and God. Six aspects of that relationship appeared as orthogonal factors in responses obtained from a random sample of adults in metropolitan Detroit. All six were found in three sub-samples: black Protestants, white Protestants, and white Roman Catholics. Compensatory and evolutionary theories of religious experience were found to be of little use in explaining the variance of respondents' scores on these factors. Hypotheses derived from a sociological perspective on religious experience showed greater power in explaining that variance.
99;1971;The theoretical expectation of Max Weber, the refinement of that expectation by Glock and Stark, and the empirical findings of Glock, Ringer and Babbie that social deprivation is related to religiosity in church-type religious institutions is further tested. Three indices of social deprivation (sex, age, and education) are combined into a composite index and correlated with indices of types of religiosity in a Roman Catholic parish. In addition, a composite religiosity index is correlated with each of the social deprivation variables: sex, age, and education. The findings substantiate the social deprivation model.
100;1971;This paper explores some of the origins of the southern Black's conversion to Catholicism and discusses the significance that this change of church affiliation may have for the traditional Negro Church. The change is viewed as emerging from the breakdown of the Negro Church's importance as an over-arching, multifunctional institution serving the social, political and economic needs, as well as the religious needs, of the Black communities. Because of the centrality of the Negro Church to Negro life in the South, the change of Blacks from their traditional forms of religious expression is seen as a special case of the general phenomenon of church-change. Change from communal forms of religious expression to church affiliations premised on individual initiative and responsibility emerges as a dominant pattern in this instance of church-change.
101;1971;"This paper outlines the transition in thought from what has been called the ""monastic ideal"" to the current stages of ""rational capitalism"". It treats the way in which the transition from sacred to secular thought systems (especially since the Protestant Reformation) has led to the establishment of an unforeseen dilemma, i.e., a trend toward a moral society of amoral members. This condition has been brought about in some ways intentionally and in other ways inadvertently, by eliminating magic from the world in the form of the societal members' acceptance of and preoccupation with papal infallibility, religious ritual, sin, and salvation. The above had the consequence of rationalizing society and allowing for greater predictability and economic gain. Many of the stages in this transition, the sum total of which now constitutes the social and theological dilemma noted above, often resulted in spite of and contrary to the avowed intentions of their unwitting creators. The paper treats the question of how these ""latent"" functions managed to ""manifest"" themselves. There is something in the air of the modern world: a defiance of authority, a contagious irresponsibility, a kind of moral delinquency, no longer restrained by religious or ethical faith. And these attitudes are now threatening not only personal serenity but also public order in many parts of the world."
102;1971;"This paper studies ways in which different Protestant churches serving Mexican Americans may articulate with the dominant society and facilitate the assimilation of their members. The data reflect the perceptions of a purposive sample of Protestant ministers of Mexican-American congregations in El Paso. Three types of ministers are constructed, and the assimilative role of each is discussed. The general conclusions are that church-sect and Protestant ethic theoretical formulations may be profitably applied to the analysis of the Mexican Americans; the most sect-like groups may socialize members into a latently assimilative ethic of personal reform, while the more church-like groups are manifestly assimilating members into an ethic of social adjustment to a complex society. In addition, there is evidence of the assimilation of the churches themselves as they move into middle class society."
103;1971;This study examined possible differences in value systems among persons falling into the four religious orientations identified by Allport and Ross based on the extrinsic-intrinsic distinction. Subjects were members of United Methodist Church groups who voluntarily filled out the Religious Orientation Scale and the Rokeach Value Survey. The findings revealed that three values discriminate between the orientations: the terminal values Salvation and Equality, and the instrumental value Forgiving. The trends in the rankings of values generally supported Allport's theoretical distinctions between the four religious orientations. Ministers participating in the present study varied from those previously studied by Rokeach by ranking the terminal value Equality higher than the terminal value Salvation. This difference was attributed to the fact that the denomination sampled in this study is more liberal than those previously studied by Rokeach.
104;1971;"This study is a preliminary attempt to understand the goals which motivate Jews to attend High Holy Day services and thereby to appreciate more fully the meaning of their Jewishness to them. A 30-item questionnaire was administered to four samples taken from the membership of three Conservative congregations, and also, for comparative purposes, to small samples of specially selected Orthodox and Reform Jews. The strongest motivation reported by Conservative Jews was ""Jewish identification"". Most of them regarded the service itself as next strongest in attracting their attendance, but those who worship at least monthly found the desire to relate to God to be even more compelling. In sharp contrast to the Orthodox, the Conservative subjects (including the regular attenders) had little expectation of influencing God by their prayers."
105;1971;Two different scoring techniques published by Feagin and by Allport for a common pool of 21 intrinsic/extrinsic religious orientation scale items developed by persons at Harvard are compared. Correlations between both Feagin's and Allport's total scales, their sub-scales, and a measure of reported religious experience (REEM) are reported. It is concluded that Feagin's scoring technique is as adequate as is Allport's and that neither Feagin's nor Allport's sub-scales can be combined to form a single, unidimensional scale.
106;1971;Two sets of Russian messianisms, religious and revolutionary, have many similar, if not identical, characteristics, and both have immensely contributed to the dominant cultural values in the Soviet Union today. In doctrine and in structure, the revolutionary movements were profoundly influenced by the religious messianism and also consistently exhibited an impressive number of undeniably religious characteristics. Both sets served very important functions in the social change surrounding the events of 1917. Paradoxically, then, the new rulership after the November 1917 coup-d'etat did not need Karl Marx or any other Western ideologist to convince their subjects of the messianic religion-like quality of monism and collectivism leading to the inevitable salvation of the millennium through twain cosmogony and other eschatological means. The Russian cultural heritage was much more congenial and, for the purpose of legitimizing the not-so-new system, vastly superior than anything Rousseau, Saint-Simon, Comte or Marx could offer. It appears then that the non-Russian Communist-ruled nations in Eastern Europe (and perhaps China) are rejecting precisely the Russian cultural heritage represented in the messianisms when they are rebelling against the Russian domination in their own cultures (or countries).
107;1971;West Indian Negroes who emigrate to England largely forsake their traditional church affiliations, but in contrast, there has been a considerable growth of sects, mostly Pentecostal, which have attracted many disaffected church members. These phenomena are analyzed in relation to social forces, with particular reference to current attitudes to black immigrants in Britain. The largest of the sects is used as a case-study with a description of sect-activities and beliefs followed by a consideration of the functions of sect membership. The whole movement is identified as millenialistic stemming out of ethnic and status deprivation.
108;1972;"185 undergraduate volunteers were administered the Harvard Group Scale of Hypnotic Susceptibility. 23 subjects scoring 0 through 4 and 26 subjects scoring 10 through 12 were given a questionnaire designed to elicit information regarding their religious background and experience. Low susceptibility was associated with perceiving one's mother as slightly religious or not religious (p < .05), and high susceptibility was associated with having undergone the experience of being ""saved"" (P < .05). When interviewed, all of the high-susceptibles who professed having been ""saved"" reported that the experience was characterized by profound experiential changes, while none of the low-susceptible group reported such phenomena."
109;1972;A group of Unitarians and a matched group of Southern Baptists were assessed as to Religious Orientation, Dogmatism and prejudice toward Negroes. Generally, Unitarians were more Extrinsic in their Religious Orientation, less dogmatic and less prejudiced than the Baptists. Although scores within the Baptist sample were similar to past reported research with Intrinsic subjects less prejudiced toward Negroes, caution was raised as to the usefulness of the Religious Orientation measures among members of nontraditional religious groups.
110;1972;A sample of 77 clergymen and 136 lay leaders, all of them members of the Lutheran Church in America, was taken in northern Illinois. It was found that even in this relatively conservative denomination, clergy tended to give more liberal responses than laity on a variety of social and political issues.
111;1972;"A theoretical and empirical problem of continuing attention is that of the origins and presentations of self, selfing behaviors, or self-designating behaviors. Research is reported examining the origins and presentations of religious self-designations given by a national sample of the United States adult population. Twenty-seven percent of the sample responded to the question ""Who Am I?"" with religious self-designations. Three interpretations of self-designations are examined: reference group theory; attitude theory; and a derivation of Mead's social behaviorism theory. Respondents' self-selected ""most important groups,"" ""religious beliefs,"" and ""religious activity participation"" are examined for association with self-designations. Moderate support is provided for the social behaviorism account of the origins and presentations of religious self-designations."
112;1972;As an aid to those doing research on individual religiosity, data are presented concerning item and scale means, standard deviations, item and scale reliability coefficients, and item and scale intercorrelations for the Scriptural Literalism Scale (Form C), the McLean Religious World Views Scale, and King and Hunt's Religious Position Scales. The data were gathered from junior college students in Dallas.
113;1972;Data from a 1969 nationwide sample of black adults revealed a weaker association between religiosity and militant attitudes than Marx found in a 1964 sample. Further exploration uncovered an interesting reason for this finding. In 1964 blacks who were more religious were less militant within each of several age, sex, and denominational categories Marx examined, whereas in 1969 this was not the case. Among older black adults, males and Baptists, the more religious were decidedly less militant, perhaps even more so than in 1964. However, among younger black adults, females and members of denominations other than Baptists, the relationship was reversed: the more religious were slightly more militant. Since additional investigation disclosed no compelling methodological reason for this finding, we suggest that it might be interpreted in terms of changes between 1964 and 1969 in the meaning of militancy to particular segments of the black population and/or in the cultural systems of predominantly black churches.
114;1972;I offer an account of Weston La Barre's The Ghost Dance to indicate the continuing vitality of a Freudian ideological attack on religious beliefs and behavior. A contemporary group of social scientists, chiefly featuring Bellah, Geertz, and Luckmann, could possibly meet La Barre's sociopsychiatric challenge to religion. I examine their reliance on functional definitions of religion as a conciliatory measure designed to overcome the conflict between religious belief and the social scientific study of religion. Despite certain logical and empirical problems in the use of functional definitions of religion, I conclude that theoretical advances have been achieved in their writings. But in a more philosophical context, which is where La Barre's analysis really belongs, I suggest that their positions are logically insufficient as a rejoinder. The bridge between religion and social science, therefore, may yet contain some shaky girders.
115;1972;In this research religious affiliation is taken as an independent variable and an examination is made of the voting behavior on abortion reform legislation of members of two sessions of the state legislature of a western state which has large groups of Catholics, Mormons, and Protestants--religious groups with differences on the abortion issue. As expected, knowledge of the religious affiliation of the legislators allows better prediction of such voting behavior than constituency, party, or age, and controlling for these three variables affects the size of the association only slightly and occasionally. The effect of the religious affiliation variable is particularly dramatized in the shift of Mormon lower house members' votes from 1967 to 1969, a time period during which the Mormon Church made official statements against abortion reform legislation. Ramifications and alternative explanations of the data are presented.
116;1972;Investigators must choose between single and multiple-item scales of religiosity. To aid in that decision, single and multiple measures were compared to determine whether they covered the same areas and formed relationships with variables from another domain. The results suggest that single-item scales (e.g., the Christological confession and the rated importance of religion) are good measures of an intrinsic proreligious position but that multiple-item scales are better measures of traditional Christian Orthodoxy. The discussion points out conditions when the less expensive but less valid measure is to be chosen over the more valid but more expensive scale.
117;1972;"Is it useful to treat the religious variable as multidimensional? Can correlational techniques identify separate dimensions? If so, are the dimensions like those proposed in the literature? A pilot study of Methodists using questionnaire data indicated ""yes"" answers to these questions. The study was repeated on a larger number of subjects from four denominations using a modified universe of items and similar factor-analytic and item-scale analyses. The earlier findings were confirmed. Ten scales, defining different dimensions of religious behavior and congregational involvement, were developed. Correlations with each other and with independent variables indicate that they may be useful, both in theoretical research and in denominational evaluation and planning. The dimensions thus defined are quite similar to those developed in the pilot study, some of which were like those hypothesized in the literature. Limitations of the study are discussed."
118;1972;It is argued that mutually inconsistent religious beliefs do not necessarily produce cognitive conflict in their adherents. Examples gathered from research undertaken in Thailand are presented showing that there are various ways people use to cope with a logical contradiction between one master religious principle to which they subscribe and certain other specific beliefs and practices to which they also subscribe. It is suggested that for Thai Buddhists, and perhaps for most people everywhere, the test of the compatibility of religious beliefs and practices is not whether they are logically consistent but whether they are felt to cohere, that is, whether they are felt to be true. Several hypotheses are developed to account for how people manage to acquire and sustain the conviction that the various elements of their religion are true.
119;1972;It is proposed that culture crises promote the growth of cult movements. Culture crises are characterized by dislocations in the communicational and orientational institutions of society, i.e., in those institutions that normally create and standardize symbols. Many of the ideological and organizational characteristics typically associated with cult movements can be interpreted as responses to culture crises.
120;1972;It was hypothesized that Christian Science college students would be less likely than other college students to major in one of the sciences. In addition, it was hypothesized that among Christian Science students, the devout would be less likely than the nondevout to major in science and less likely to be academically successful. Data gathered from a large midwestern state-supported university showed, however, that while Christian Science students were indeed less likely than other students to major in the behavioral and life sciences, they were no less likely than others to major in the physical sciences, and they were more likely than others to major in engineering. Moreover, the devout were more, not less, likely than the nondevout to major in science, and they were about as academically successful as the nondevout.
121;1972;Previous research has found that parental control and support are jointly related to religiosity among urban Catholic adolescents. The present research yielded substantially the same findings among a sample of Mormon adolescents in a small university town in the western United States.
122;1972;Research on intrinsic and extrinsic religion has been troubled by conceptual diffuseness and questionable scale validity. Hunt and King have proposed greater specificity in conceptualization and measurement in future work. This paper attempts to specify and measure a single crucial dimension identified by Hunt and King, namely ultimate versus instrumental religious motivation. Two validation studies were done utilizing persons nominated by ministers as having either ultimate (intrinsic) or instrumental (extrinsic) religious motivation. A new 10-item Intrinsic Religious Motivation Scale is proposed, and measurement problems are discussed.
123;1972;"Research on ministerial effectiveness has not produced results of maximum value to the churches. The major problems which have hampered this research are delineated in this paper. They include the use of secondary rather than primary criteria, the selection of general ministerial functions, the lack of collaboration with church leaders, laity, clergy and theologians in assessing effectiveness; use of the rating mode of measurement, and the changing nature of functions in the parish ministry. Suggestions are provided to help resolve the problems."
124;1972;"Taking the Weberian use of the term ""secularization"" as a point of departure, the author has questioned the identification of the term with the abandonment of religious beliefs per se. He distinguishes between two kinds of abandonment, namely eradication and effacement. These two concepts refer to distinct phenomena growing out of very different social conditions and circumstances. Eradication is an abandonment of religious rituals, symbols, or beliefs that reflects a loss of faith in underlying religious values, whereas effacement is an abandonment that does not reflect such a loss. Three cases of symbolic change which occurred in a Djerban synagogue in Israel are discussed and the analysis is extended through a comparison with a Lele ritual. The three Djerban examples in the Israeli environment and the Lele ritual were found to be instances of effacement. In all four cases the very act of abandonment of the religious symbols, which was due to the fact that the particular symbols in question no longer conform with the experiential situation of the actors, actually led to a reaffirmation of the symbols."
125;1972;"The author examines (1) the conditions under which religion is most likely to perform its comfort and challenge functions and (2) the extent to which religion today tends to perform these two functions. Evidence from Baptists and Methodists in two Indiana communities indicates that the comfort function is positively related to the maintenance of ""vertical"" beliefs, but is not associated with ""horizontal"" beliefs; the prophetic function is positively related to ""horizontal"" beliefs, but is negatively related to ""vertical"" beliefs. Finally, the data indicate that religion tends to provide comfort and support more than it inspires social protest and change."
126;1972;The authors classified articles in the sociology of religion that appeared in five journals from the inception of these journals to 1969. It was found that the proportion of articles about religion has remained more or less constant over the years. There has, however, been a strong trend toward quantitative studies. Over half the quantitative research has dealt with some aspect of individual religiosity, and religious variables have been treated as independent almost as often as they have been treated as dependent. Only about a third of the quantitative articles contain an identifiable theoretical framework, and most of them continue to use rather simple methods of data analysis. Almost none of the articles are longitudinal or cross-cultural.
127;1972;The LAM scales permit the measurement of three religious meaning-commitment possibilities (Literal, Anti-literal, and Mythological) rather than the usual fundamentalistic-literalistic type of commitment which many single scales tend to measure. Twenty-five items consisting of three alternatives each, based upon McLean (1952), were given to 173 college students. The LAM scales consist of the 17 items which were retained on the basis of substantial item-scale correlations of each item alternative on its respective scale. Ways are discussed in which multiple scales like the LAM would force reinterpretation of studies of religious changes in college students and of research on the relation of religion to social-personality variables such as prejudice and hostility.
128;1972;"The personality of seminarians in three successive class groups was measured with three inventories near the beginning and end of their training program. Significant changes across class groups were related to five institutional objectives dealing with emotional stability, vocational maturity, desire for the parish ministry, concern for people, and commitment to a specific theological position. Conclusions include: 1) personality change is measurable at the seminary level; 2) the changes can be associated with institutional objectives; 3) nonpersisters are different from persisters; 4) similar patterns of change occurred over the seven-year period; and 5) the personality portrait of a seminarian includes characteristics specific to an individual seminary."
129;1972;"There is a growing segregation of adult instrumental roles from the kind of expressive relationships associated with familial settings. Many modern adolescents therefore rebel at the prospect of participating in conventional adult occupations. A frequent reaction in recent years has been to drop out of career roles and to cultivate expressive, ""loving"" life-styles in ""street scenes"" and communes. But the hippie counterculture has generated problems of its own. In the early days of the movement it was widely believed that drug use would usher in a new era of spontaneity and universal affection, but many soon realized that drug use involved them in roles that contradicted the love ethic. Moreover, many soon found themselves ill at ease in a milieu so radically at odds with the traditional work ethic. By joining the Meher Baba cult, the subjects of this study rejected the counterculture in favor of a different way of fulfilling the need for postadolescent expressive relationships. The Meher Baba cult, which opposes drug use, legitimates expressive relationships by deriving them from converts' perceived affective relationship with Meher Baba, Who is seen as the personification of the latent identity of all persons and as quintessentially ""loving."" His immanence universalizes and thus legitimates loving relationships not only among Baba Lovers but among everyone. By enjoining ""social service,"" Baba deprives the drop-out life-style of legitimacy, endows work with expressive meaning, and facilitates his followers' reassimilation into conventional work roles."
130;1972;This exploratory study reports findings concerning the premarital sexual standards of a group of teenage United Methodist church leaders from eastern North Carolina. Comparisons are made between these findings and the findings of studies of other samples of young people. Interpretations of the findings are offered and further research questions are proposed.
131;1972;This paper examines the hypothesis that members of the urban working class are significantly less involved (associationally) in the church than are members of other occupational strata. Using data from a national sample of adult, male, Catholic heads of households in Italy, a statistically significant but very weak positive relationship was discovered.
132;1972;This paper presents some previously unpublished data from the Current Population Survey's 1957 interview sample on religion. All of the available data from this sample have now been published. Our review of these data indicates that there has been a structural convergence between white Protestants and Catholics, but that the Jews and blacks have not been parties to this convergence. The necessity for future questions on religion on both the monthly Current Population Survey and the decennial census is discussed.
133;1972;This paper questions the assumption that religion, or its functional alternatives, inevitably provides the basis for the cultural integration of all societies. In modern societies the process of differentiation has reached the point at which a normative order based on religious beliefs and values is no longer possible. This development, however, coincides with increases in productive capacity which tend to make less difficult the tasks of motivating enough individuals to work and of providing legitimacy for the social order. As a religious basis to the normative order becomes less necessary, religion will continue to have functions for certain strata and for private individuals, but these functions will be more likely to be expressive than utilitarian.
134;1972;This study presents a comprehensive bibliography on the relation between religion and aging. One hundred and forty social science journals were surveyed, 80 from their inception and 60 over the last 25 years. The results reveal four major areas of research effort: (1) church participation, (2) religion and the personal adjustment of the aged, (3) the meaning of religion to older persons, and (4) religion and death. The results also show that sociologists of religion are responsible for only a small part of the literature on religion and aging. This finding is surprising in view of the significance attributed to death by most sociological theories of religion.
135;1972;Two hundred subjects were dichotomized into extrinsic and intrinsic along the dimension of Personal Religious Orientation (Allport, 1968). Tests for differences between means of these two groups revealed a significant tendency for the intrinsics to hold a more positive view of human nature as measured on the Philosophy of Human Nature Scale (Wrightsman, 1964). A further comparison between the upper and lower quartiles of the same sample revealed that the differences occurred primarily on the subscale designating trustworthiness, in that instrinsics perceived people to be more trustworthy than did extrinsics.
136;1973;3,617 male, employed, Protestant clergymen were studied in order to explore whether and how clergymen of various occupational specialties are differentiated on the basis of vocational interests. Respondents are classified into 10 occupational subgroups by means of a biographical questionnaire. Occupational subgroups are compared on the basis of scores on 10 role scales of the Inventory of Religious Activities and Interests, both by profile comparison and discriminant function analysis procedures. Findings indicate, by both analytic procedures, that subgroups of clergymen classified in this manner can be differentiated on the basis of interest in performing activities associated with 10 roles. Twenty-two of 45 possible pairs of specialty groups are significantly differentiated in respect to profile shape. Seven dimensions which best describe interests contrasted therein are reported.
137;1973;A cognitive consistency framework was adopted to predict that a believer's level of self-esteem and his location on the locus of control dimension influence his description and definition of God. On a sample of 128 Catholic subjects with approximately identical religious backgrounds, self-esteem was positively related to loving-accepting God-images and negatively to rejecting images. Locus of control was unrelated to controlling beliefs. Statistical and methodological controls were utilized to offer an interpretation that self-esteem may be a major determinant of God-images. It was proposed that these findings have important implications for understanding the dynamics of personal religion.
138;1973;A study of all the utopian communities for which records are readily available that were founded within the current boundaries of the 48 contiguous American states between 1776 and 1900 reveals that communities having a single religious faith practiced by all members tended to survive for longer periods of time than did communities favoring a plurality of religions or no religion at all.
139;1973;An apparent inverse relationship between intellectualism and attendance at religious services is examined in a secondary analysis of cross-sectional data collected in 1963-1964 in a sample of New York City residents. There is no relationship between intellectualism and attendance when religious group is controlled. Jewish respondents, in particular, displayed decreasing rates of religious attendance and increasing rates of intellectualism when analyzed by generation. A decreasing rate of attendance by generation was more characteristic of Jews low on intellectualism than those high on intellectualism. Among white Protestants, attendance diminished across generation for those low on intellectualism, while it increased for those high on intellectualism. Data are also reported for white Catholics and for blacks of all faith. The differences are among generational categories at a single point in time.
140;1973;Four dimensions of religious belief related to the Love-Guilt complex in Christian theology were proposed along with a fifth dimension of Conventionalism or culture-oriented belief. A universe of items thought to tap these dimensions was administered to 160 students from three seminaries in Southern California and the data were submitted to a Likert scaling technique. The final scales measured Guilt-oriented, Love-oriented (both Self-centered and Other-centered), and Culture-oriented (or Conventional) religiosity. Except for Conventionalism, the scales were essentially unrelated to the Allport-Ross Extrinsic and Intrinsic scales. All scales were unrelated to social class. The Guilt and Love-Self scales were positively related to each other and to Conventionalism. The Love-Other scale was negatively correlated with Guilt and uncorrelated with Love-Self and Conventionalism. The Love-Other scale was positively related to a Guttman-type scale of Attitudes Toward Church Involvement in Social Action, and the Allport-Ross Extrinsic scale was unrelated to Church Involvement. All other scales were negatively related to Church Involvement.
141;1973;"Four theories purporting to explain patterns of prejudice among church members were tested separately and simultaneously using matched samples of Presbyterian and Methodist church members in the North and the South. Status concern and dogmatism were the strongest determinants of prejudice in both North and South. Religious variables such as orthodoxy and ethicalism proved to be weaker and associated only with anti-black prejudice, not anti-Semitism. Allport's theory of intrinsic-extrinsic religiosity and prejudice was not supported; it is argued that past research findings on intrinsic-extrinsic religiosity can be interpreted in terms of status concern and dogmatism. The strongest determinants of prejudice among church members appear to be personality factors rather than religious beliefs."
142;1973;Glock and Stark have argued that theological pluralism in local church congregations seldom leads to conflict since members tend to associate with like-minded congregants and thus remain unaware of the extent of theological diversity. This research tests and provides empirical support for part of this argument. Specifically, members of two doctrinally heterogeneous but apparently cohesive churches were found to perceive the beliefs of the majority of their congregation to be similar to their own, suggesting that ignorance of pluralism probably does exist.
143;1973;"Individual realities of persons claiming to have had encounters with others known to be dead often mark the experiencing individual as pathological. Nonetheless, a survey of the available literature shows that the experience is common both in preliterate communities and among the recently bereaved; some authors have indicated that it is more common among contemporary Americans than is normally presumed. The present study queried 434 respondents in Greater Los Angeles, divided approximately equally among black, Japanese, Mexican and European origins, whether they had experienced such an encounter. Approximately 44 percent responded positively, with over 25 percent of these persons indicating that the dead person actually visited or was seen at a seance, while over 60 percent of the incidents involved a dream. A sufficiently large proportion of all population categories have experienced the presence of a dead person to make this phenomenon worthy of further investigation as being subjectively important."
144;1973;It is the contention of this paper that there is interpretive value in looking at aspects of mystical experience from the perspective of the psychological development of man's growth from childhood to maturity. It is not argued that mystical experience is a simple function of psychological crises in human development, but it is maintained that psychoanalytic interpretations of human development do provide clues for gaining a new perspective on mystical experience and can contribute to building a mystical anthropology. The mystical traditions of India provide the context for the analysis. Based on these many traditions it is possible to suggest a four-fold typology of mystical experience oriented primarily around the stages of human development. Enough texts are readily available in the Sanskrit literature to set the typology in a psychological, sociological, and linguistic framework that is reasonably homogeneous and integral. The typology includes the following kinds of mystical experience: (a) unitive, (b) isolative, (c) copulative, and (d) nihilative.
145;1973;Measures of anti-Semitism were obtained in December 1970 from college students of differing religions. The mean opinion scores were compared with each other, and also with those obtained from an earlier study of students enrolled in the same course during 1965 and 1966. Anti-Semitism among Catholic students was significantly less in 1970 than in 1966, but a similar decline was not evident for Protestants or Jews.
146;1973;Much of the literature exploring motivation for drinking beverage alcohol asserts that people drink to resolve conflict over dependency wishes or feed their sense of dependency. David McClelland and his associates contend that people drink to make themselves feel more powerful. Two types of need for power are identified: personalized need for power (p-power) and socialized need for power (s-power). McClelland's hypotheses for social drinkers were adapted and tested with 121 Roman Catholic and Episcopal clergymen--65 alcoholics and 56 nonalcoholics. It was found that alcoholics are characterized by p-power and nonalcoholics by s-power or no need for power, regardless of denominational affiliation. Support is offered for the inference that clergy with personalized need for power tend to drink excessively (and later become alcoholics) whereas clergy with socialized need for power or no need for power tend to drink less (and hence are less likely to become alcoholics).
147;1973;Operationalized categories for the experience of transcendence were developed from Stace's criteria of introvertive mysticism. From 123 Ss who took Allport's Religious Orientation Scale, 25 extremely extrinsic Ss and 25 extremely intrinsic Ss were identified based upon independent use of the Extrinsic and Intrinsic subscales. These Ss were then asked to volunteer for interviews concerning their most significant personal experiences. These completed interviews (20 intrinsic, 21 extrinsic) were then coded on the basis of our operationalized categories for the experience of transcendence. Results indicated that, as predicted, groups of intrinsically oriented Ss reported more experiences codifiable as transcendent than did groups of extrinsically oriented Ss. The importance of these data for the validity of Allport's assumption of experiential aspects of intrinsic religiosity as operationalized in the Allport-Ross Intrinsic Scale is discussed. Also, the importance of the sympathetic study of these paradoxical experiences is briefly emphasized.
148;1973;Recent data from polls suggest a trend away from conventional religion among college youth and impressionistic evidence indicates some stirrings of new forms of religion. A survey of Berkeley students provides an opportunity to examine the nature and sources of religious loyalty, defection and experimentation. The analysis shows that religious experimentation is not an isolated phenomenon but is rooted in broader cultural disaffection and is closely associated with other kinds of countercultural behavior. Among the sources of religious defection examined, cognitive sophistication and several types of psychological stress seem to be the most significant factors.
149;1973;Religious differences in educational attainment and persistence in school are investigated in an analysis of data from a 1957 national survey. Although no consistent Protestant-Catholic educational differences are found in gross comparisons, some Protestant advantage does appear after the introduction of controls. Controlling for ethnicity, region of birth, age, generation, father's occupation, and size of community of orientation, Protestants are consistently found to be somewhat more likely to achieve a college degree and are substantially more likely to persist in college once enrolled. These differences are largest among men with higher status origins.
150;1973;"Robert Bellah's ""symbolic realism"" is an epistemological orientation which asserts the existential ""reality"" of religious symbols without necessarily accepting their factual reality. It thus implies a common distinction between empathy, as the intuitive comprehension of subjects' meanings, and sympathy, as the internalization of these meanings. However, an approach which is empathic without being totally sympathic encounters special difficulties when applied to field observation of extreme sects such as the ""Jesus Freaks,"" which define their own meanings as exclusively true and thus assume that to know the truth is necessarily to ""believe."" A participant observer who is perceived as empathic but who resists conversion thus implicitly threatens the sectarian meaning system and may disorient and demoralize subjects. The subjects' resulting defensive behavior may then disorient the researcher and inhibit further empathic communion. Regidly exclusive sects may thus constitute a limiting case of symbolic realism, which may presuppose tolerance and pluralism."
151;1973;Seventy active members of Episcopal congregations were asked to indicate their preference for a set of questionnaire items composed of personality characteristics and typical role activities of clergymen. The preference for personality characteristics was significantly stronger than for the role-activity items. Moreover, the intrinsic-extrinsic orientation of the respondents, as premeasured on the Allport Personal Religious Orientation Scale, was not significantly related to their choices. Some implications of these findings for seminary curricula are briefly explored.
152;1973;"The American Churches witnessed the radicalizing of a significant and vocal segment of their clergy during the last decade. This essay seeks to understand this phenomenon by offering a typology of American religious movements. Our analysis reveals that the ""new breed"" represents the advent of a new social reform movement which shares some salient traits with reformers who were generated by the American Churches in previous eras of activism. This similarity renders possible both a more precise adjudication of the basic thrust of the ""new breed"" and a more exacting assessment of its probable impact on subsequent religious life in this society."
153;1973;The authors suggest that confusion about differential growth rates among various kinds of churches might be clarified by examining the sources from which churches draw their new members. In the authors' investigation of membership additions to 20 evangelical congregations over a five-year period they found that over 70 percent of the new members came from other evangelical churches (reaffiliates such as migrants or transfers) while nearly another 20 percent were the children of members. Less than 10 percent were proselytes or converts from outside the evangelical community, and even these were primarily recruited from other churches or became members through intermarriage. This finding suggests interesting implications for evangelicals with the specific goal of proselytism. The authors argue that conservative churches may be growing faster than other churches because of their superior ability to retain their children and their mobile members.
154;1973;The dimensions of Sanskritization--the taking on of life styles of ritually high castes--is explored through the factor analysis of survey data gathered in rural northern India from among some 1300 individuals representing 11 castes varying widely in ritual status. Sanskritization is found to be multidimensional consisting of separate dimensions related to world view, involvement in religious rituals, and egalitarianism with regard to treatment of low castes and women. Treating Sanskritization as Hindu religiosity, we find that the relationships between the observed dimensions of Sanskritization and social status show striking similarities with relationships which have been observed to hold between dimensions of religiosity and social class in the West. It appears that in both India and the United States involvement in religious ritual is more common among persons of higher social status while belief in the supernatural is more common among persons of lower social status. A second major finding is that, on the basis of differences in patterns of religiosity, the castes studied fall into three groups clearly ranked in terms of ritual status, thereby suggesting need for renewed attention to the concept of varna in studies of caste in modern-day India.
155;1973;The effects of current occupational status and intergenerational differences in occupational status upon individual beliefs in doctrinal orthodoxy are examined in light of three hypotheses. A dissociative hypothesis would predict excessively high levels of orthodoxy for mobile persons, suggesting that the consequences of social mobility would work to counteract processes of secularization. An acculturation hypothesis would predict that mobile persons will be intermediate in degree of orthodoxy to persons at their strata of origin and destination, suggesting that in the societal context of an excess of upward over downward mobility, social mobility would generate a net increase in secularization. A cognitive dissonance hypothesis would predict excessively low levels of orthodoxy among mobile persons, suggesting that social mobility reinforces processes of secularization. The data generally best fit a model consistent with the acculturation hypothesis, though sufficient deviations occur to warrant a discussion of the conditions which foster dissociative and dissonance effects as manifested in orthodox religious beliefs.
156;1973;The Religious Association Scale (RAS) was administered to students enrolled in an introductory psychology course (N = 121). RAS was found to correlate positively with all four single-item measures of religiousness. It also correlated positively with scholastic aptitude. A factor analysis of the intercorrelations showed that RAS loads on both a religious criterion factor and the aptitude factor. These results suggest that RAS should be modified in an attempt to suppress its relationship with intelligence.
157;1973;"The thrust of the civil religion literature has been called into question by the work of both Luckmann and Fenn. These latter scholars--here called privatists--deny the need for wide cultural legitimations in advanced societies, suggesting especially that dominant institutions are guided by and accepted in terms of functionally rational criteria rather than broad ideological schemes. However, the privatists (and the ""end of ideology"" school they represent) overlook evidence suggesting the continued importance of cultural consensus--at least among the dominant classes--and they overlook the possibility that functional rationality itself is a legitimating system of meaning. Further, the privatists ignore the likelihood that emergent social strains will exacerbate dissensus and create new pressure for explicit civil legitimations. Thus, while itself requiring modification, the analysis of civil religion remains crucial for students of religion."
158;1973;"This paper presents a brief review, classification, and critique of one source of national sample data on religion, public opinion polls which are available through the Roper Public Opinion Research Center. The focus is on the types of question asked, including a cataloguing (in the Appendix) of questions of a religious nature asked of national samples since 1938. Special note is taken of those questions which represent time series sets. Methodological and substantive limitations are noted; nevertheless, the authors conclude that the Roper Collection constitutes a wealth of useful and relatively untapped information regarding traditionally oriented religion in America."
159;1973;This paper reexamines a great deal of research that has dealt with psychological maladjustment and glossolalia, including more recent studies of tongue-speaking in middle- and upper-class groups. Issue is taken with the conclusion of some recent research that there is no relationship between psychological or personality factors and glossolalia. Some data commonly used to substantiate this conclusion is reexamined and found to support rather different conclusions, though many of the studies looked at are faulted on methodological grounds. Special attention is given to the much-cited but unpublished work of Lincoln Vivier. It is argued that misleading conclusions may have been drawn from this important study. Suggestions are made for further research on glossolalia that would allow more definitive conclusions to be reached.
160;1973;"This research explores the consistency of cognitive style. It was hypothesized that a ""closed"" cognitive style would be associated with a consensual type of religiosity and an ""open"" cognitive style would be associated with a committed type of religiosity. Instruments used to measure the major variables were: Rokeach's Dogmatism Scale and Spilka's Religious Viewpoints Scale. The sample consisted of 264 college students. Factor analysis and multiple regression were employed in the analysis. The findings indicate that the Religious Viewpoints Scale did not differentiate well between committed and consensual types of religiosity, but alpha factor analysis showed that the scale seemed to be measuring these two dimensions of religiosity. ""Closed"" (as opposed to ""open"") cognitive style was more positively associated with consensual religiosity than with committed religiosity; this finding was significant at the .001 level."
161;1973;This study examines the religious preferences, regions of residence, and social-class positions of two groups of political ideologues--members of the John Birch Society and the Americans for Democratic Action. It is shown that Birchers, in contrast to ADAers, are likely to live in the South or the West and to belong to theologically orthodox Christian denominations. ADAers are more likely to live in the East or Midwest and to be Jews, Liberal Protestants, or to have no religious preference. Birchers tend to have lower social-class positions than ADAers. Multiple Classification Analysis reveals that these three variables--religion, region, and class--explain 59 percent of the variance in political organization membership, and that religious preference alone accounts for half of the explained variance.
162;1973;Using symbolic interactionist theory to derive the basic proposition that an empirical relationship between the creedal and consequential dimensions of religiosity should appear only to the extent to which one's relgious identity is salient, we examined a sample of Protestant church members in Indianapolis (N = 604). A relationship appeared only for those dependent variables in which the organized church was directly implicated, and even then only in the very highest salience category. With the proviso that a very high level of salience is required to produce a relationship, all of the other studies of the relationship of religious orthodoxy to political attitudes and behavior fall neatly into place. Evidence is also presented which indicates that the theory predicts behavior at the extremes of the creedal continuum, making separate theories of religious and political extremism unnecessary.
163;1973;"What is the result of the research stimulated by Lenski's ""The Religious Factor?"" This research testing hypotheses derived from Weber's Protestant Ethic thesis focused on Protestant-Catholic differentials in social status and mobility, in achievement motivation, and in educational and scientific performance. Most of the data were nonsupportive of, or contradictory to, the hypotheses derived from the Weber thesis. None of the research was adequate to the task of causal inference which is required by the logic of the hypotheses. Moreover, the independent variable--differences in religious belief--was not adequately operationalized. Finally, the researchers are criticized for the simplistic derivation of poor hypotheses from the analytically rich work of Weber."
164;1974;"A measure of intense religious experience was related to measures of psychological strength in two studies. In the first study a significant negative correlation was found between intense religious experience and Barron's (1953) measure of ego-strength. However, this correlation was reduced to insignificance when the religion subscale was removed from Barron's total Ego-Strength Scale. In the second study intense religious experience was more frequent among persons classified as low on Stark's (1971) Index of Psychic Inadequacy than among persons classified as high. The importance of assessing the relationship between intense religious experiences and psychological health by independently operationalized measures is stressed. Also, the possibility of nonpathological evaluations of intense religious experiences commonly labeled ""mystical,"" ""peak,"" or ""ecstatic"" is discussed."
165;1974;A study of 321 randomly selected pastors of five denominations in the Los Angeles metropolitan area revealed that theological position was the best of three predictors of opinions and activities concerning a variety of social issues. The other predictors were denominational affiliation and extrareligious values (humanistic versus traditional). Contrary to Benton Johnson's hypothesis, extrareligious values were not a better predictor of position on social issues than theology.
166;1974;"Allport and Ross's Religious Orientation Scale has been widely criticized for lack of conceptual clarity. The present research employs the scoring technique devised by Ralph Hood which allows for the identification and measurement of four, rather than three categories of Religious Orientation. The new fourth category is labeled ""indiscriminate antireligious orientation."" Data were collected from adolescents (and their parents) attending Catholic parochial and Sunday schools in various parts of the United States. Using the Rokeach Dogmatism Scale, analysis showed the indiscriminately antireligious to be the most open-minded of the four categories of religious orientation, and to be significantly more open-minded than the extrinsics and the indiscriminately proreligious. Caution is urged in interpreting Hood's procedure for scoring the religious Orientation Scale, and questions are raised concerning the validity of the scale when used with Catholic subjects."
167;1974;Although much progress has been made toward understanding how sects develop, currently available typologies and theories cannot account for how all sects develop. Sociologists have tended to restrict their studies to relatively nonradical sects confronting relatively tolerant societies in ways that are passive or only mildly militant. In short, they have studied the kinds of sects common in English-speaking countries. They have not dealt adequately with really radical sects or with sects operating in intolerant environments. In this paper it is argued that sect development involves a dialectical process between sect and host society. What sects become in time is not simply a function of their initial characteristics taken by themselves but is the product of an ongoing process of interaction with their environments. This perspective is illustrated by discussing the histories of the Old Colony Mennonites and the Mormons and by drawing out of these histories some implications for future studies of sect development.
168;1974;Although scholars have assigned an important role to religious organizations in the modernization and development process, they have paid far more attention to the role played by such secular organizations as trade unions and fraternal organizations. This study represents an effort to utilize some of the tools traditionally applied by political scientists in studies of secular organizations to deal analytically with the part religious organizations play in modernization. Specifically, it is an attempt to account for the greater political interest and activity shown by religious sects among the Kikuyu tribe than by sects among the Zulu, a tribe whose milieu during the first half of this century has been similar to that of the Kikuyu. An examination of the development of sects in these tribes suggest that commitment to ideological purity is a key variable in explaining variations in the degree of sectarian political activities. The cases also suggest three major factors which may explain a sect's long-term efforts to preserve its ideological purity: (1) the degree of bureaucratization, (2) the degree to which recruitment is open, and (3) the emphasis its founders place on one or more local customs as the justification for the sect's existence.
169;1974;"An observational and interview study of Seattle's ""skid road"" missions suggests that although the official objectives of the missions are not successfully achieved, the missions live on because they effectively realize the personal goals of their leaders and the men who attend."
170;1974;"Benton Johnson's question, ""Do holiness sects socialize in dominant values?"" is reexamined. Data from an empirical inquiry designed to help answer this question are discussed. It is argued that the data indicate that certain features, beliefs, and practices of the United Pentecostal Church, the holiness sect from which the informants were selected, do socialize the sect's members in some of the central values of American society."
171;1974;Catholic Pentecostalism is a rapidly growing movement within the American Catholic Church that mainly appeals to college students, middle-class adults and clergy. Observation, interviews and questionnaire data on participants and nonparticipants illuminated sources of recruitment to the movement. More generic factors than the forms of economic and social deprivation so often emphasized in the study of religious movements appear to facilitate recruitment to Catholic Pentecostalism and other movements. People are more likely to be attracted to a movement who are exposed to it in person, share its problem-solving perspective, have few social obligations that might conflict with membership, and have or develop social relationships with members. These factors appear to have an additive impact on the likelihood of recruitment. They are probably only necessary conditions for recruitment to highly unconventional movements requiring intense commitments.
172;1974;Criticism of the church-sect typology leads to the conclusion that a multidimensional model of analysis needs to replace the typological method. A proposed alternative is founded on the proposition that religious institutions organize religious experience into structures of authority, which can be analyzed along four dimensions--symbolism, structure, intensity, and pervasiveness. Various uses of this method are suggested and two cases are evaluated by it. An argument is advanced that the method may have the cross-cultural applicability which church-sect theory has lacked.
173;1974;Glock, Ringer, and Babbie have argued that people who become involved in church are seeking a comfortable refuge from the deprivations associated with being old, female, unmarried, or having a small income or little education. The present research tests this thesis using data from a provincewide sample of adults in Alberta. No support for the thesis is found among any denominational grouping. When the thesis is broken down into its component hypotheses, however, the pattern of relationships that emerges is one that has long been familiar to sociologists.
174;1974;"Hirschi and Stark (1969) reported very little relationship between religious involvement and adolescent delinquency. They concluded that religion is therefore ""irrelevant to delinquency."" The present paper offers an alternative interpretation of their findings and tests one of its implications. It is hypothesized that Hirschi and Stark's findings apply only to offenses against persons and property, and that a clear relationship between religion and delinquency should be found for ""victimless"" crimes. Data from high-school students in the Pacific Northwest replicate Hirschi and Stark's findings but also reveal a moderately strong relationship between religion and the use of marijuana and alcohol. Suggestions are made for further tests of the alternative interpretation."
175;1974;"In a previous study of a state-supported university in the Southeast, no statistically significant differences were found in the personal religiosity of faculty in scientific and nonscientific disciplines. On the other hand, faculty in fields in which religion is likely to be studied (eg, sociology and psychology) were found to be less religious than faculty in fields in which religion is not studied (eg, engineering and physics). The present research was undertaken to determine whether these results are generalizable to another region and to other types of schools. The data, gathered from faculty at 15 schools in a large Midwestern metropolitan area, suggest that the earlier results can be generalized, but only to secular colleges and universities. In church-related schools virtually the opposite relationships obtain; in those schools faculty in scientific fields are less religious than faculty in nonscientific fields, whereas there is no systematic relationship between faculty religiosity and the extent to which a faculty member's discipline involves the study of religion. The different patterns observed in church-related schools are probably traceable to the concentration of faculty pursuing religious vocations in fields involving the study of religion."
176;1974;In recent years some scholars of religion have observed that religious belief in the United States is so declining rapidly that a post-Christian era seems both inevitable and imminent. Survey data for national samples of Americans suggest, however, that there has been no appreciable decline in levels of religious belief in recent years and that the generational factor does not play as crucial a role as has been thought. Analysis of Gallup data shows that between 1957 and 1968 levels of belief in two basic Christian tenets (belief in an afterlife and belief in the devil) remained about the same. At the same time, however, there was a marked decline in the proportion of Americans expressing uncertainty regarding these beliefs, and an increase in the proportions openly espousing disbelief. It is our contention that past researchers have failed to distinguish between decline in belief and increase in disbelief.
177;1974;In reviewing studies of the association between Christianity and ethnic prejudice, moderately active church members were found to be prejudiced but highly active members were as tolerant as nonmembers. The more intrinsically religious, nonfundamentalistic, and theologically discriminating persons were also more tolerant. These conclusions held regardless of when the studies were conducted, from whom the data came, the region where the data were collected, or the type of prejudice studied. It appeared that holding a strong value position which allowed one to stand outside of the value traditions of society at large was crucial in adopting a nonprejudiced position and was typical of both nonreligious and highly religious people. Additional personality characteristics were not needed to explain the relationship between religion and prejudice. No conclusions can be currently drawn about the role of the institutional church in developing or reducing prejudice.
178;1974;"Many clergymen have responded to the ambiguity in their social role by combining secular employment with their religious work. After considering possible ways in which religious and secular roles can be combined, data are presented from a national questionnaire survey of 620 ""nonstipendiary"" Episcopal priests. Findings are (1) the nonstipendiary clergyman closely resembles his parish counterpart except for a significantly greater amount of advanced secular education, (2) there is a unique group of clergymen who have always been nonstipendiary, (3) the occupational situs changes of the men in the sample, while substantial, are nevertheless predictable and (4) the nonstipendiary clergyman has a strong commitment to his unique occupational role. The nonstipendiary movement contains substantial implications for the church as an organization and for the ministry as an occupation. It is most appropriately seen as ""occupational role recomposition."""
179;1974;"One of the most recently developed methods in anthropological science has been labeled ""The New Ethnography."" This approach looks on culture as a cognitive organization of material phenomena, as a way of knowing and ordering reality. The task of the researcher is to unearth and understand the logical organizing principles underlying human behavior. This he does by elicting from his informants the questions they formulate about the world around them as well as the answers they give to them. This method has not been employed in the study of religions on a large scale. The few applications have been encouraging because they have brought into focus the religious experience of a particular people. They also show that greater objectivity and accuracy in the analyses of values, beliefs and ideals can be achieved and thus increase the understanding of other peoples' religious life. The new ethnography can supply us with useful guidelines for the improvement and development of the academic study of religion. It also suggests that ""empathy"" training for scholars in the field might be pursued with advantage."
180;1974;Rates of approval of abortion by liberal and conservative Christian nurses and social workers in Tennessee are analyzed using survey data to investigate hypotheses suggested by Johnson's findings that support for the Republican Party rises with church attendance among conservative Protestants but declines with church attendance among liberals. Our findings suggest that (1) members of liberal Christian denominations are more likely than members of conservative denominations to approve of abortion but, contrary to our predictions, (2) among both conservatives and liberals, frequent church attenders are less likely to approve abortion. These patterns of association remain when other factors related to abortion are statistically controlled. Furthermore, religion is found to be the single most important predictor of attitudes toward abortion among the factors considered.
181;1974;"Scientific approaches to religion have always alternated between functional and substantive definitions of the field--that is, between defining religion in terms of its social or psychological functions and in terms of its believed contents. Recently there has been a predominance of functional definitions, as exemplified by Bellah, Geertz, and Luckmann. Quite apart from the scientific utility of these definitions, they have come to serve an ideological use--as a quasiscientific legitimation of the avoidance of transcendence. This is in accord with a secularized Zeitgeist, but it threatens to lose sight of the very phenomenon of religion. To regain the phenomenon, what is required is a return to a substantive definition, an understanding of religion ""from within."" Schutz's analysis of ""multiple realities"" in human experience may serve as a useful starting point for this."
182;1974;"Sociological studies of the concept of personal normlessness or anomie have, since Durkheim's time, strongly emphasized socioeconomic ""causes."" Data are reported here which suggest that certain religion variables may be of greater importance than socioeconomic factors as sources of variance in personal normlessness."
183;1974;Soviet civil ceremonial rites, ceremonies introduced at different periods in Soviet history, have drawn little attention from students either of the Soviet Union or of religious phenomena. Provided here is an overview of events significant in the development of the ceremonies, an overview of the descriptive features of the most important public and private ceremonies, and an examination of the question of the success of the ceremonies in Soviet society. Whereas there is little doubt that most of the public ceremonies--such as the anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution and May Day--have achieved wide acceptance, the Soviet private ceremonies of birth, coming-of-age, and marriage have also achieved a measure of genuine success. The Soviet funeral ceremony has, however, achieved little acceptance. The new Soviet private ceremonies, with the exception of the funeral ceremony, should be seen therefore not as meaningless and empty, but as genuine competitors of their religious counterparts, and as particularly adaptable to urban conditions within the R.S.F.S.R.
184;1974;"The dilemma which the political unrest of the sixties caused for organized religion is set forth and some of the sources of activism and inactivism in the churches discussed. Data are presented from a 1968 survey of 1,580 Protestant clergymen at the parish level in California, showing that church leaders were highly polarized over a wide range of issues during this period and that many liberal ministers were active in the political controversies of the 1960s. Such ""new breed"" activists met with considerable resistance from their congregational members, however, and many lost members and finances. The reassessment and retrenchment presently taking place within liberal denominations are discussed in light of these findings--drawing, in part, upon recent interviews with church leaders in California. It is concluded that important changes are taking place at the national level--particularly in the loss of a large number of nonparish positions--but that the situation in local parishes is not a great deal different today than in the sixties. The dilemma over social activism within liberal churches is expected to continue in much the same form in the future."
185;1974;"This paper addresses the issue of whether religiosity is really multidimensional as suggested by Glock and Stark and numerous other researchers. The ""religiosity in 5-D"" scales devised by Faulkner and DeJong (1966) to operationalize the Glock-Stark typology were completed by 873 students in 1967 and 656 students in 1970 at a small, private liberal-arts university in Florida. Each of the 5-D scales more than adequately met the minimum criteria of Guttman scaling in both data sets. The results of a factor analysis (varimax and oblique rotation) of the 23 items in both data sets indicated the predominance of the Ideological commitment factor which accounted for 78 and 83 percent of the common variance respectively. A second-order factor analysis confirmed the existence of one general factor. Our conclusion is that religiosity is not multidimensional."
186;1974;This paper demonstrates that it is feasible and useful to insert positive and negative assumptions about the supernatural into scientific theories of religion. The logic of constructing theories makes it possible to insert such statements into theories as postulates, along with ordinary propositions from general systems theory and reinforcement theory, and then to deduce testable propositions. The logical procedures to follow are carefully described, and several examples are given. It is shown that when differing assumptions about the supernatural are made, differing and opposed empirical propositions about religious behavior can be deduced. It is also shown that incorporating assumptions about the supernatural can produce testable propositions not usually considered by scientific students of religion.
187;1974;This study investigated the relationship between religious persuasion and fear of death in physically healthy persons and terminally ill patients. No differences in the intensity of fear of death were found between believers and unbelievers. Personal nearness to death also did not reveal any meaningful differences between believers and unbelievers. What did emerge was a pattern generally characteristic of all the populations studied, highpointing an ambivalent acceptance-avoidance approach toward fear of death.
188;1974;"We explore the question of why civil religion might arise in the first place. Essentially the argument is: (1) the condition of religious pluralism creates special problems for social interaction; (2) social interaction, in such situations, is facilitated by a universalistic legal system; (3) a universalistic legal system may, therefore, be elevated to the sacred realm. Actually, the data bear on only the first two of these propositions, showing that the association between legal development and societal complexity increases with every increase in religious pluralism. We prepare the groundwork for the plausible claim, therefore, that, in the absence of a universally acceptable meaning system (traditional religion), the legal order may become a universally acceptable substitute (civil religion)."
189;1975;"A measure of reported mystical experience is presented. This ""Mysticism Scale, Research Form D (M scale),"" has 32 items, four for each of 8 categories of mysticism initially conceptualized by Stace (1960). Items on this scale are both positively and negatively expressed to avoid problems of response set. A factor analysis of the M Scale indicated two major factors, a general mystical experience factor (20 items) and a religious interpretation factor (12 items). Preliminary evidence indicates that those high on the M Scale have more intrinsic religious motivation as defined by Hoge's (1972) scale, are more open to experience as defined by Taft's (1970) ego permissiveness scale, have more intense religious experience as defined by Hood's (1970) scale, and have moderately higher scores on the L, Hs, and Hy scales of the MMPI."
190;1975;A sample of 234 college undergraduates were clustered into relatively homogeneous religious types based on the similarity of their religious profiles on three scales of religious commitment delineated by Hunt (1972): Literal, Antiliteral, and Mythological. Consistent with Hunt's previous notions, the Mythological commitment was a prominent one among subjects tested. However, a second contention of Hunt's -- that proreligious subjects of different substantive orientations might differ in terms of personality characteristics -- was not supported. Literally-oriented religious Believers did not differ significantly from Mythologically-oriented Believers on measures of intelligence, authoritarianism, or racial prejudice. Religious Believers as a group were found to be significantly less intelligent and more authoritarian than religious Skeptics.
191;1975;A semantic differential administered to liberal, moderate, and conservative laity (N = 511) identified three dimensions of theistic imagery in which a traditional conception of God's goodness, mercy, and justice was dominant. The first dimension, traditional imagery, was strongly related to certainty of belief in God's existence and other orthodox Christian beliefs, as well as to devotionalism and ritual observances. It and certainty of orthodox belief each independently influenced religiosity. A second dimension of anthropomorphic imagery was unrelated to piety, but appeared to reflect cognitive sophistication. A third, bi-polar dimension described lay perceptions of God's immanence and scrutability. Liberals are here separated from conservatives by a lesser preference for traditional imagery (reflecting their greater doubt about orthodox beliefs).
192;1975;Based on three measures of religiosity collected in a national sample, about one-fourth to one-half of the population could be considered religious. Catholics are more religious than Protestants, who are more religious than Jews, and females continue to be more religious than males.
193;1975;Four dimensional solutions were found to underlie dissimilarity judgments among 16 world religions by respondents from four categories of religious affiliation. Multidimensional scaling procedures resulted in a Foreign-Local and a Godless-Fundamental dimension common to all affiliative categories. A dimension of Power was shared by all but the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints members while a Social Acceptability dimension was used by both Catholics and the L.D.S. The United Church of Canada members and respondents with No Religious Affiliation shared in their use of an Open-Closed dimension whereas the L.D.S. generated a unique Chosen People dimension.
194;1975;In spite of extensive assumptions to the contrary, there is little theoretical or empirical justification for expecting some type of systematic and unvarying relationship between religiosity and secular attitudes. Beliefs and attitudes are a social product. If a given attitude object is not receiving ongoing attention in religious social networks, then attitudes toward that issue will be a result of other nonreligious, personal-social characteristics. To investigate this question indices of religiosity, of personal-motivational attitudes, of attitudes toward social activism, and a variety of social-demographic variables were examined for their relative impact on a number of social attitudes for Roman Catholic Pentecostals. The results indicate that religiosity indices are associated only with those social attitudes having direct implications for ongoing doctrinal or church-related considerations.
195;1975;"Is ""religion"" multi-dimensional and, if so, what dimensions are of use in the scientific study of religion? Previous studies by the authors defined religion in terms of involvement in congregational life, developed several potentially useful dimensions, and suggested scales to measure them. The findings occurred with members of four Protestant groups within one urban area but left unanswered the question: Are the similarities found those of mainline Protestantism or of the local sub-culture? Selected items from those studies were used, with others, on a nation-wide sample of another denomination. Using the same techniques of factor and item-scale analysis, the national data produced the same dimensions and almost identical scales. Therefore, these dimensions seem to be potentially useful in studies of most Protestants in the U.S. and perhaps Canada. Other questions, however, remain to be answered: Are all the findings artifacts of the particular techniques of observation and analysis? Are these different ways of being religious or reflections of different underlying psycho-logic characteristics of persons?"
196;1975;Previous research has shown a fairly consistent relationship between religion and/ or religiosity and attitudes towards abortion. Data from a 1972 national sample is presented showing the importance of ideal family size as an intervening variable in this relationship and argues for its inclusion in subsequent research in this area.
197;1975;Previous studies of Catholic and Protestant achievement aspirations have provided mixed support for the fusion of white Christians into one homogeneous group. Using three-wave panel data for Catholic and non-Catholic high school students (N=287), homogeneity in levels and changes in levels of relative income expectations were examined. Within each religious group males were hypothesized to have higher expectations, to be more likely to raise expectations over time, and to be less likely to lower expectations over time than females. The results indicated mixed support for the hypothesized Catholic and non-Catholic homogeneity. While males were remarkably similar both in levels and in changes in levels over time, Catholic females had higher expectations than non-Catholic females for one wave. Non-Catholic females were about twice as likely as Catholic females to make upward shifts in expectations, and about three times as likely to make downward shifts. While previous studies have used level homogeneity as evidence that religious groups are fusing into one homogeneous group, the results of this study point to the necessity of considering process differences.
198;1975;Recent anthropological and sociological studies have emphasized the cognitive functions of religion, but few have drawn on relevant work by cognitive social psychologists. One current social psychological approach, attribution theory, is especially promising for the study of religion because it deals directly with individuals' interpretations of their own experiences and behavior. Three lines of attribution research are reviewed and each is shown to be useful for understanding certain religious phenomena. A classic conversion experience discussed by William James, the experiences of the apostles at Pentecost, an experimental study of mystical experience, and several examples from an American Nichiren Shoshu group are considered in the light of attribution theory. Possibilities for experimental research are briefly considered.
199;1975;Soviet sociologists have studied the Russian Orthodox Church from a relatively objective scientific perspective. Reviewing their work indicates that contemporary Orthodox believers do not adhere to any complex and coherent belief system. However, funeral and baptismal rites have persisted as well as Church attendance on religious holidays provided churches are available, although it is not clear if this is primarily due to the older generation. Personal practices such as praying at icons have decreased in recent years. The Orthodox faith seems to have little interaction with secular conduct. Of the several elements of religiosity, practice appears central to the Russian Orthodox.
200;1975;"The nature of participation of Italian Communists in the ritual of the Catholic Church is examined. Two models are presented--a normative marxist model excluding Church participation by Communists and a popular Italian model which portrays the mass of Communists as being fundamentally Catholic. Neither model is found to be satisfactory in light of the evidence from the locality under study. It is found that the great majority of the Communists continue to turn to the Church for rites of passage. At the same time, however, the Communist Party has to a great extent supplanted the local churches as the sponsor of ""rites of community."""
201;1975;The Protestant missions in Ramah, New Mexico, have had a much stronger appeal to Navajo women than men in recent decades, and the novel religious-institutional experience can be correlated with other adjustments to a changing socio-economic environment. The meaning of the Protestant mission experience is examined in light of traditional female life styles, and it is concluded that church affiliation is simply one expression of the Navajo women's attempt to create sex roles commensurate with the realities of changing cultural circumstance.
202;1975;The relationship of fear of death to selected religious attitudes was studied as a preliminary test of hypotheses that fear of death may motivate religious faith and may be allayed by some but not all religious orientations. Subjects were 70 members of 2 Protestant and 1 Catholic congregations in a small mid-South town. Death concern was negatively related to intrinsic religion and self-rated religious concern in the total sample. Patterns among fear of death, dogmatism, extrinsic religion, and age in the Protestant congregations suggested that particular denominational traditions or doctrines make some religious attitudes particularly salient to the fear of death.
203;1975;The research relates four independent variables to the voting behavior of legislators in a western state on the question of abortion reform during three sessions of the state legialature. The four variables include religious affiliation, party, age, and rural-urban constituency. Special attention is given to religious affiliation because of the assumed saliency of abortion reform for certain religious groups. The state chosen for study has large groups of Catholics and Mormons, both of which are opposed to abortion reform on theological grounds. Results indicate that religious affiliation was a better predictor of legislative voting on abortion reform than any of the other variables.
204;1975;This essay is specifically an argument for a synoptic orientation for the study of the psychology of religion. The argument derived from a historical review of the field begins with the problem of lacking a coherent and comprehensive methodology, proceeds with definitions of the two traditional research orientations (the empirical and the phenomenological), shows their major weaknesses, and concludes with historical evidence in support of the thesis. The main distinction between the orientations is that the empiricists insist that knowledge is reducible to sensory experience such as observation and the phenomenologists reject this claim insisting that knowledge is not reducible to sensory experience. Thus an orientation is needed which includes the strengths of both the empirical and phenomenological views and which excludes their weaknesses. Such an orientation is the synoptic which includes the rigor of empiricism without its reductionism and includes the challenge of the phenomenologists without their insufficient means for validity.
205;1975;This study attempts to analyze the characteristics of the religious movements related to societal change. Only by comparing their most recurringly typical attributes in as many diverse cultural contexts as possible do the common patterns of religion and societal change emerge with striking clarity. Data are taken from numerous early Christian, Apostolic Poverty, Croat, Czech, and German movements. These patterns are drawn from empirical evidence as if the term sect was never invented and the church-sect typology (and other labeling inherited from the past) never existed. The results reject Durkheim's dogmatic, unwarranted, and value-permeated statements, but support Weber's qualified, tentative, and neutral propositions. Durkheim's influence on American sociologists, in contrast to the lip service paid to Weber, is in part causative of the poverty of sociological theory on religious movements. This in turn nourished the myth of convergence or synthesis of Weber and Durkheim.
206;1975;This study was designed to determine religious and religiously neutral biographical correlates of self-actualization in evangelical seminary students. Self-actualization was measured by the Personal Orientation Inventory (POI). A structured interview which included a scale by Rotter and one by McClosky was used to measure religious attitudes, beliefs, and practices, and to measure political-social attitudes, family structure, demographic data, and level of moral development. The population consisted of 164 seminary students at a theological seminary in the southwestern United States. On the basis of the subjects' POI scores three samples of 15 students each were chosen to represent high, moderate, and low levels of self-actualization. Differences among the actualization groups were found for denominational loyalty, ecumenical attitude, personal plans for church vocation, reported socio-economic level, status of mother's occupation, liberalness of political attitude on concrete issues, and birth order.
207;1975;"Two alternative approaches to the conceptualization and analysis of salience in religious commitment are examined: specification and linear, additive models. Using data from a North Carolina sample of Episcopalians, little evidence is found in support of a specification effect. Considerably more support is obtained, however, for a linear, additive formulation in which salience is conceptualized as intervening between localistic world view and orthodoxy, as independent variables, and four consequential dimension measures. Salience is shown to have a ""counter effect"" to that of orthodoxy in the cases of church activism, political conservatism, antiblack prejudice, and racism. Issues pertinent to further research on religious salience are raised."
208;1975;Using a Durkheimian framework this model employs deficiency variables in an attempt to explain change of religious affiliation. All four independent variables (deficit of social rewards, deficit of consistency of life experiences, deficit of religious solidarity, and personal influence) were predicted to be positively related to the dependent variable. Data on 3574 inquirers enrolled in a course of instruction on the tenets of the Roman Catholic Church between 1958 and 1965 were analyzed to test the four major hypotheses. High rates of religious affiliation change occurred among inquirers with two or more deficits who were engaged or married to a Catholic.
209;1975;"With data collected in 1972 from a probability sample of 412 white Catholic women aged 20 through 44, four sets of variables were found significantly to differentiate rates of contraceptive nonconformity to the ""Humanae Vitae"" encyclical. While both age and parity relative to desired family size were highly associated with the dependent contraceptive behavior measure, the latter was the single most important predictor of contraceptive noncompliance. With parity relative to desired family size controlled, both religiosity and alienation also provided significant differentials in contraceptive conformity. These results were then discussed from the perspective of generational and historical changes."
210;1976;Certain concepts in the theory of art might be applicable to the psychology of religion, particularly when one realizes that in ontogenesis the individual tends to be introduced at once to art and religion. This paper describes first the reciprocal reinforcement between art and religion in childhood and subsequent cultural experience. It goes on to suggest that significant understanding of religion can be gained from a systematic application of the art-theoretical constructs of craft, imagination, and illusion. The dubious status of satisfaction (or pleasure and pain experiences) in art and religion is surveyed, leading to the proposal that the numinous satisfaction of religion has a unique, irreducible quality.
211;1976;"Contrary to previous studies, results indicated that Mennonite university students (""conservative Protestants"") were in significantly greater agreement with parental religious teachings than were United Church students (""liberal Protestants""), with Roman Catholic students being intermediate. The reported emphasis placed on religion in the childhood home was only partially related to these differences in agreement. Several measures of religious beliefs and practices were also examined, and the present findings are discussed in light of seemingly contradictory previous studies."
212;1976;"Data were collected from 307 teachers in two universities to examine the import of intellectual culture on religion. The relative effects of home culture, academic training, effect of academic discipline, and professional factors on religious beliefs and church commitment were tested. The ""scholarly distance"" theory of Lehman and Shriver, concerning differential impact of disciplines, was not supported. There was little evidence of a ""religion of science"" functionally equivalent to, and competing with, traditional religion. The strongest predictors of college teachers' religiosity were childhood religion and home culture. Religious commitments seem to have strong noncognitive sources which are little affected by intellectual training."
213;1976;Does religion promote prosocial behavior? A verdict is not clear. Methodological and theoretical weaknesses in recent studies correlating religious orientation with social values (e.g., prejudice) led to the proposal of a new three dimensional model of religiosity. Religion as a Quest was considered along with the well known Means and End orientations (cf. Allport's extrinsic and intrinsic religiosity). These three dimensions were operationalized by use of complete-estimation factor scores on three factors derived from six religious orientation scales. Convergent and discriminant validity of the scales and factors were examined using both seminarian and undergraduate samples. Finding satisfactory validity, the three dimensional model was employed in three studies concerning the relationship of religious orientation and prosocial behavior. Study 1 suggested that the frequently reported link between intrinsic (End) religion and less prejudicial questionnaire responses could be an artifact of social desirability. Studies 2 and 3 concerned helping behavior. In both, the Quest orientation was found to relate to more tentative, situationally responsive helping. The End orientation related to more persistent helping that was less attuned to the expressed needs of the person seeking aid.
214;1976;In this study a theoretical model is presented which highlights the reinforcing potential of religious reality construction and the mobilizing potential of formal religious organizations. It is hypothesized that rates of devotionalism (a measure of the intensity of religious organizational participation) are positively related to the performance of helping behavior. A qualification by type of helping behavior (emergency or ordinary) is presented. Sequential stepwise multiple regression analysis indicated that devotionalism was a predictor of three of the four types of ordinary helping behavior examined while church attendance consistently predicted emergency helping behavior. The introduction of a subjective religiosity measure did not increase the R2. The effect of church attendance on emergency helping behavior is found to be primarily through churches' provision of organizational means for participation. Implications of the findings for the exchange-reinforcement perspective are discussed.
215;1976;"Investigation of the topic of sectarianism suggests the benefit of greater interchange between sociological subdisciplines. Delineating two ""traditions"" of sect analysis, largely ignored by sociologists of religion, this paper notes their emphasis on ""non-religious"" and particularly political sectarianism. The utility of these ""underground"" traditions for sociologists of religion is indicated, as is the contribution which the ""mainstream"" study of sects may make to the study of social movements. Location of the sect in a broader context is seen as relevant to an understanding of the complex relationship between the religious and the secular, and as crucial to a full historical and comparative understanding of the phenomenon itself."
216;1976;Networks of several distinct types of social tie are aggregated by a dual model that partitions a population while simultaneously identifying patterns of relations. Concepts and algorithms are demonstrated in five case studies involving up to 100 persons and up to eight types of tie, over as many as 15 time periods. In each case the model identifies a concrete social structure. Role and position concepts are then identified and interpreted in terms of these new models of concrete social structure. Part II, to be published in the May issue of this Journal (Boorman and White 1976), will show how the operational meaning of role structures in small populations can be generated from the sociometric blockmodels of Part I.
217;1976;"One historic function of institutionalized religion is the designation of life's ultimate concerns and the provision of strategies for coping with them. Yinger's functional definition of religion is used in this study to discern (1) what the residents of an urban neighborhood in the Deep South define as life's ultimate concerns, and (2) the strategies they use to cope with them. The findings help support Luckmann's contention of the existence of ""invisible religions"" in modern society and disclose the existence of privatized expressions of religiosity possibly unconnected with formally organized, institutionalized forms. The data lend credibility to those theoretical innovations which conceive of religion in very broad terms."
218;1976;Religious practices of black and white adolescents in a southern community were measured between 1964 and 1974 by the variables frequency of church attendance, frequency of Bible reading, and grace at meals. Questionnaires were administered to 367 adolescents in 1964 and 432 in 1974. Analysis of variance was used in analyzing the data. Adolescent religious involvement was found to be declining. The decline is especially great for males according to data analyzed here. It was also found that differences in religious practices were greater for sex than race in church attendance and Bible reading but greater for race in the saying of grace at meals.
219;1976;"Surveys of Williams College men in 1948, 1967, and 1974 asked about religious beliefs and related attitudes. The percentage of students rejecting home religious traditions increased from 1948 to 1974; the shifts were to more liberal and humanistic viewpoints. Church participation and positive attitudes toward the church both decreased from 1948 to 1974, but orthodoxy of religious beliefs did not change after 1967. The percentage of students reporting a reaction at some time against parental beliefs rose from 57 percent in 1948 to 79 percent in 1974, and the median age of the reaction fell two years in that time. The effect of college on students' religion has decreased, suggesting that the main period of formulation of religious views has shifted to an earlier age, more in high school than college."
220;1976;The acceptance of Christianity by the ruling classes in tenth-century Russia caused the occurrence of contra-acculturative movements of a religious nature which lasted for at least two centuries. This report explores the characteristics and results of such movements, and of the leaders of such movements. This series of historical occurrences is examined from an anthropological perspective.
221;1976;"The concept of face is clarified and distinguihed from other closely related constructs: authority, standards of behavior, personality, status, dignity, honor, and prestige. The claim to face may rest on the basis of status, whether ascribed or achieved, and on personal or nonpersonal factors; it may also vary according to the group with which a person is interacting. Basic differences are found between the processes involved in gaining versus losing face. While it is not a necessity for one to strive to gain face, losing face is a serious matter which will, in varying degrees, affect one's ability to function effectively in society. Face is lost when the individual, either through his action or that of people closely related to him, fails to meet essential requirements placed upon him by virtue of the social position he occupies. In contrast to the ideology of individualism, the question of face frequently arises beyond the realm of individual responsibility and subjective volition. Reciprocity is inherent in face behavior, wherein a mutually restrictive, even coercive, power is exerted upon each member of the social network. It is argued that face behavior is universal and that face should be utilized as a construct of central importance in the social sciences."
222;1976;The effects of set and setting in determining whether or not persons in wilderness solitude had religious experiences were investigated. After persons returned from three days in wilderness solitude, reports were obtained on the following types of religious experience: 1) mystical experience, 2) meaningful experience, and 3) whether persons had been in the state of relating to nature more or less communally. Three set factors were included--1) trait of general attitude toward nature, 2) state of relating to nature during the experience, and 3) felt stress--and one setting factor: location. More mystical experiences occurred under the communal setting of low stress. Meaningful experiences occurred more often when set or setting were more communal. More communal states of relating to nature occurred when setting was more communal.
223;1976;"The historical development of church-sect theory is analyzed, and two major points are made. First, insufficient attention has been paid to the role of church-sect in its original use by Max Weber and, in particular, in the context of his treatment of the ideal type. Second, since the work of Ernst Troeltsch, the use of church-sect in the sociology of religion has been beset by the ""Troeltschian syndrome""--a misdirected focusing upon Troeltsch's use of these concepts in developing a ""sociological formulation"" for solving a theological problem, rather than on the sociological problem itself. Recent contributions are assayed with these points in mind and placed in critical perspective to the work of both Weber and Troeltsch."
224;1976;The hypothesis that religiosity reduces anomie in modern society is re-examined. Anomie was not found to be inversely related to religiosity. An inverse relationship between anomie and class was not reduced by religiosity. Controls for acquiescent and social desirability measurement error did not alter this finding nor did the substitution of an alternative measure of anomie.
225;1976;"The object of this paper is both critical and constructive. The first section contains a critical account of some leading interpretations of the rise of modern sociology in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in Europe, concentrating primarily on Durkheim but refering also to Max Weber. I try to show that these interpretations, still very commonly held, have to be abandoned as myths. Like all myths, however, they contain a rational kernel, and in seeking to show what this might be, I indicate some lines of development which I consider to be important in sociology in the present day. Most characterizations of the current travails of social theory are concerned with issues of epistemology, that is, with problems of the sorts of ""truth claims"" that can be made in sociology. These matters, undeniably of pressing importance, are related to legacies from 19th-century social thought which we have to disavow. But there is another residue of the 19th century with which we have also to break: this is represented by what I cal the theory of industrial society. An essential task facing contemporary social theory is that of reconciling a revised epistemology of social science with new frameworks for the analysis of the development of advanced societies."
226;1976;The paper examines the relationship between fishermen's taboos, a form of ritual behavior, and a number of sociocultural variables. Taboo usage was positively related to time spent at sea and negatively related to socialization in a fishing family. These interrelated findings strongly support the risk and ritual hypothesis proposed by Malinowski by showing that within a single dangerous occupation, degree of ritual covaries with the degree of risk involved.
227;1976;The question was raised regarding the empirical support for Sorokin's cyclical theory of philosophical, religious, and scientific movements. Transhistorical measures of creativity and philosophical beliefs were used which spanned 122 generations (or 20-year periods) from 540 B.C. to 1900 A.D. in Western history. An analysis of non-transformed and first-differenced data indicated that (a) philosophical beliefs form two postively correlated Sensate and Ideational clusters, (b) Sensate times are associated with scientific creativity and Ideational times with religious activity, and (c) these relationships hold solely for immediate generational fluctuations since the time-wise trends for Sensate and Ideational systems are the same. An alternative explanation was proposed which may better fit the data but which casts doubt on Sorokin's forecast of a new Ideational age of religious activity.
228;1976;The reliability and validity of Yinger's non-doctrinal religious statemens were assessed using data from undergraduate students attending a state university in the Upper South. There was little internal reliability for the seven items taken as a single index. A factor analysis shows that the items fall into two factors (acceptance of belief and order and the value of suffering), and these are related to traditional, institutional religious concerns as measured by doctrinal orthodoxy, associational involvement, devotionalism, and sectarianism.
229;1976;"The social correlates of interest and belief in astrology are examined using data from 1,000 respondents in the San Francisco Bay Area. The data show widespread openness to the claims of astrology, interest in horoscopes, and knowledge of astrological signs, although firm belief in astrology is less prevalent. Looking at the social location of commitment to astrology reveals the greatest amount of commitment is among traditionally marginal social groups, although there is also some indication it has been nourished by the so-called ""counterculture."" Some evidence is also presented which suggests astrology may function as a surrogate for more conventional religious commitments."
230;1976;This paper concerns the problem of how residential succession affects the character of one set of local organizations: small businesses in racially changing neighborhoods. A key issue examined is the extent to which the causes and consequences of residential succession account also for the succession of small-busines organizations. Only one type of succession is examined in this paper: the movement of blacks into areas previously occupied by whites. The impact of the transition in residential population on the abandonment of business sites and/or the turnover of business from white to black or Puerto Rican ownership is the particular focus of inquiry. Results of the analysis indicate that the residential succession model fits our data on business succession quite well.
231;1976;This paper found that conservative churches with congregational polity will have a greater tendency to sponsor new church-related schools than liberal churches or churches with hierarchical polity. Social class of church membership and size of the congregation were not significant factors.
232;1976;"This paper investigates the contribution of community to ethnic stratification is Israel. We show that ""development towns,"" a category of new settlements established to achieve population dispersal and immigrant absorption, have influenced (a) the areal distributions of different ethnic (country-of origin) group, (b) the tendency for each group to be concentrated in certain industries, and (c) the occupational opportunities available to the members of an ethnic population. We also review the relevance of this analysis for understanding ethnic stratification in America."
233;1976;This paper investigates the distribution of influence in determining policies and actions in eighty-five Roman Catholic dioceses. Based on the responses of over three thousand diocesan priests, the influence structures were centralized both in the actual and ideal situation for all dioceses. In a comparison with union locals, Leagues of Women Voters, and stations of a delivery company, the religious organizations were found to be the most centralized and to have the least amount of total influence operating within the system. The nature of the professionalism of the Roman Catholic diocesan priesthood and the impact of innovative reforms stemming from the Second Vatican Council are discussed in the light of these results.
234;1976;This paper tests several models of the diffusion of a religious movement over time and space. The Holiness movement was chosen as a case study because of its consistent presence on the American religious scene. I developed an index of movement strength using data on the establishment and operation of Holiness oriented periodicals and schools. The index was then mapped for subsequent time periods in order to trace the movement's diffusion in time and space. The questions of how and why the movement spread were then analyzed. Several geographically descriptive models of diffusion were surveyed, with a directional sector model receiving the greatest support. Several explanatory variables were also surveyed, with population migration, reaction to national crises, and reaction to contemporary related movements receiving support.
235;1976;"This research reports results of a personality assessment of members of a fundamentalist Jesus movement commune in an effort to address questions about what type of persons are attracted to or developed by such experiences and whether or not such experiences should be viewed as maladaptive. Personality self-conceptions of 83 members (66 males and 17 females) of the group were compared with those of a normative sample of college students who were similar in age, educational, and socioeconomic characteristics. The results generally indicate a ""maladaptive"" pattern of self-conceptions, although substantial cultural differences between this group and the normative sample require that such an interpretation be qualified. Implications of the findings for personality theory are discussed, with special attention given to defining of maladaptivity and to the problem of the relationship between maladaptivity and religiousity. The ramifications of results concerning the genesis of the Jesus movement is discussed, with particular reference to deprivation theory."
236;1976;This study analyzes publication trends in the psychology of religion for the purpose of identifying the recent history and current status of the more prominent research areas in the discipline. Based primarily on publications since 1950, it classifies the publications according to six dimensions of religion. It then compares the dimensions in terms of total number of publications at five year intervals to 1974. The directional dimension is found to be the leading area of publication, followed in order by the dispositional, social, mythological, experiential, and ritual dimensions. The paper then analyzes shifts of emphasis in the discipline over the past twenty-five years, and assesses the current strengths and weaknesses of the psychology of religion.
237;1976;Three phases in the diffusion of Simmel's thought within the American sociological community are identified. His influence is then traced, first, in the area of general theoretical orientations, and second, with respect to research traditions on the stranger and social distance. Part II, to be published in the next issue of this Journal, will discuss Simmel's influence on other substantive areas.
238;1976;"Using a structural perspective, Lofland's concept of ""disembodied access"" is related to deviant religions in American society. Specifically, this paper investigates the influence of the United States Postal Service as it channels and constrains the organizational development of a sample of 27 religious groups whose members and leaders correspond almost exclusively by mail. Three structural adaptations of these groups are discussed as consequences of relying on the mails for existence: procedures of recruitment, commitment maintenance, and the distribution of charisma. It is concluded that the structure of the postal system confronts these religious groups with unique constraints that interact with more general dilemmas to limit organizational growth, more so than in the case of religious groups not relying so heavily on the mails."
239;1977;As a test of the assimilationist versus the subcultural hypotheses concerning the persistence of religious value differences in modern industrial societies, the relationship between religious orientations and attitudes toward several dimensions of women's role is investigated among a sample of white, urban, middle-class women in South Africa and the United States. Utilizing Goodman loglinear analysis, the results indicate support for the subcultural position. Religious differences exert an effect of relatively large magnitude either directly or in combination with other variables on sex-role attitudes. The data suggest, however, that although specific types of religious orientations persist and are similar in both societies, religious subcultures are affected by the secular value system of the country in which they are located.
240;1977;Caporale's contention, which holds that susceptibility to change within the Catholic Church is a function of the interplay of the power structure, the ethico-dogmatic system, and the characteristics of church membership, is tested by examining the Australian Catholic Church in relation to Catholic immigration. The Australian Church is analysed in terms of a model, consisting of 'Rome,' 'the Australian hierarchy,' and 'the parish.' Its organizational nature is examined, not only in terms of migration policy and official accounts of implementation, but also in terms of the actual responses to the immediate situations involving migrants. The data confirm Caporale's contention and provide some confirmation of macro theory as applied to organizations.
241;1977;"Data from eleven nations and five polls from 1947 to 1975 give responses to belief in God, Hell, the Devil, Heaven, Life After Death, Approval of Religious Intermarriage, and Importance of Religious Beliefs as well as Church Attendance. Belief in God is wide-spread and has changed little in recent years; belief in Life After Death is held by fewer people and has been declining."
242;1977;Experimentation, a research method that has proven extremely useful in other areas of psychology, has been used only rarely in psychology of religion. The value of experimentation lies in its effectiveness in testing scientific theories. Lack of experimentation may be one reason there has been so little progress in developing and testing scientific theories in psychology of religion. But ethical and practical restrictions make it unlikely that experimentation will ever be widely used in research on religion. Quasi-experimental methods do, however, seem possible. Several quasi-experimental designs particulary relevant to psychological research on religion are discussed, and greater use of quasi-experimental methods is encouraged.
243;1977;"Heretofore there have been no published studies on personality changes resulting from glossolalia which included assessment prior to the experience. This research attempted to study the effects of this phenomenon by measuring persons in ""Life in the Spirit"" on personality and attitudinal variables pre, post, and three months after the seminar. Persons who became glossolalic were compared to those who were already glossolalic and those who did not become glossolalic. No one of the groups was psychopathalogical at pre-testing time. Although persons who did not become glossolalic were higher in depression, hostility, and anxiety at the beginning of the seminar, all groups were similar at the time of follow-up. All persons changed in the direction of personality integration. However, those who became glossolalic did not change more than those who did. The results were interpreted primarily as a function of attending the seminar rather than of the glossolalic experience. The use of appropriate controls for alternative experience, sex, and ethnic background were suggested for future research."
244;1977;In an effort to test the empirical accuracy of concepts used to describe religious sects and to generate new insights into sect organization and development, Wilson's (1969) sect typology was examined through a comparison with an empirically-derived, scaled configuration of religious sects. Measures of unit (sect) similarity were calculated for a sample of twenty-one American Protestant sects and a nonmetric multidimensional scaling (MDS) was performed on the resulting similarity matrix. A two-dimensional solution was obtained, with axes representing sectarian retreatism from the secular world and level of organizational precariousness. In addition, doctrinal and organizational features were discovered which differentiated among classes of religious sects. Differences between the scaled configuration of sects and Wilson's typology, together with other interesting patterns observed in the data, point out the utility of MDS approaches for the analysis of religious organizations.
245;1977;In order to explore the structure of religious attitudes and possible interindividual differences 120 Ss rated six religious concepts on 60 semantic differential bipolar scales. The results of a three-mode factor analysis indicated six interpretable factors among items: a general evaluative factor, a specific evaluative factor, a traditional Christian factor, a traditional pietistic factor, an activity factor, and a familiarity factor. Two person mode factors demonstrated a difference among respondents who classified themselves as Christians, Christians with reservations, and non-Christians. These factors were interpreted as an affective untraditional and a cognitive traditional factor. Three concept mode factors were tentatively interpreted as factors relating to the persons in the Deity, describing the continuum religious-non-religious, and reflecting the variable human religious behavior contra divine action, respectively. The relationships between the modes were examined.
246;1977;"Interviews with 66 residents of a Taiwanese village about their folk religion revealed that there is no simple division between believers and unbelievers, but rather that people's belief can be classified into four types, or modes: Intellectual belief, which tries to make sense out of reality; true belief, which accepts everything with total credulity; practical belief, which evaluates religious tenets on the basis of evidence; and non-belief, which declares the folk religion irrelevant. These findings bear on the anthropological question of ""the new intellectualism,"" suggesting that both the intellectualist position, which declares that people believe religious tenets literally, and the anti-intellectualist position, which declares that religion is purely a metaphor for something else, are overly simple in that they do not consider individual variations."
247;1977;"Intrinsic religious orientation was related to six factor scales from the California F scale items for denominational college students. The results cross validated a prior item analysis of the entire F scale. Only two factors (""conventionalism"" and ""superstition and stereotypy"") accounted for the previously-reported relationship between authoritarianism and intrinsic religion, and these factors were independently judged to be highly salient for ""sincerely but traditionally religious Baptists."""
248;1977;"Johnson's argument that social distance is the underlying dominant characteristic distinguishing church and sect is applied to Hinduism. So-called ""clean castes"" are seen as constituting a Hindu church and low castes are seen as each constituting separate sects. The locus of power in Hinduism is examined along with types of priests and congregations within the church as well as within low caste sects. The popular notion that Brahmins' power derives wholly from birth is rejected in favor of the view that at birth Brahmins inherit only the potential for religious authority and that maintenance of their power requires Brahmin priests to heed the wishes of their congregations."
249;1977;Most investigators have concluded that religion is largely irrelevant to understanding deviance, but they have tended to rely on bivariate research models. Studies dealing with the problems of predicting behavior from measures of verbal attitudes suggest that religious attitudes must be combined with other social situational constraints for a better understanding of behavioral outcomes. Using data collected from Mormon teenagers in three western states, good prediction of deviance was obtained when religious indicators were combined with measures of peer and family relationships. Consistent with the expectations of Burkett and White (1974) religious variables were more strongly related to victimless than to victim deviance. Peer and family expectations were more important for victim deviance, especially for boys.
250;1977;Religious and ethnic identifications are typically regarded as produced by national factors. The question here is the extent to which locality must also be considered along with measures common throughout the country in creating models of religious and ethnic identification. Survey data on members of a large number of United States Jewish communities indicated that the national factor of denominational preference was the dominant variable. But locality, along with generations in the U. S. and family life cycle, were influential. Socio-economic factors accounted for very little identification variance. Hence, the locality complex, which involves local history, institutions, and leadership, ought to receive more attention in religious and ethnic research done at a national level.
251;1977;"Since the emphasis of the research was to examine language use in prayer meetings and commitment mechanisms in the process of induction, seven Catholic pentecostal prayer groups were studied by participant observation and by interviewing key members. These data show that testimony (or ""witnessing"") is the central commitment mechanism. Although glossolalia may serve as a symbol of commitment, testimony is a greater commitment mechanism since it includes both acts of involvement and abandonment."
252;1977;Studies on religion and death have usually treated both domains in unidimensional terms, but our theory suggests different forms of personal religion are related to different aspects of death perspectives. To assess these hypothese Intrinsic-Committed and Extrinsic-Consensual religious expressions were related to a set of newly developed death perspective instruments. The hypotheses gained substantial support with Intrinsic-Committed faith associating positively with viewing death in terms of an Afterlife of Reward and as Courage and negatively with a variety of undesirable death views. In contrast, Extrinsic-Consensual faith correlates with views of death as Loneliness-Pain, Indifference, Unknown, Forsaking Dependents, and Natural End.
253;1977;The effect of anticipatory set stress and setting stress on the elicitation of reported mystical experience was investigated in a natural, field context of a planned nature experience. Those persons anticipating low stress in stressful activities and settings scored higher on a measure of reported mystical experience than persons anticipating high stress in stressful activities and settings. Further analysis of a low stress activity not anticipated as stressful affirmed that anticipating low stress for a stressful activity, and not simply setting stress per se, most adequately accounts for the report of mystical experience. The relevance of these data for the positive function of set and setting stress incongruity in making one aware of both personal limits and the possibility of transcendence is briefly discussed.
254;1977;The multi-dimensional nature of prejudice and religiosity suggests that contradictory relationships reported in the literature might stem from different operationalizations of either or both variables. Eight dimensions of religiosity and four of prejudice were measured with high school students to determine if the relationship varies as a function of the dimensions measured. Ritual, knowledge, and orthodoxy dimensions of religiosity were not related to any dimension of prejudice. Fanaticism and importance, however, were negatively related to all four measures of prejudice. Consequential religiosity, by contrast, was positively correlated with all four measures. The relationship between religiosity and prejudice definitely varies with the dimension of religiosity measured, if not with the dimension of prejudice.
255;1977;"The relationships of socioeconomic status and belief-orthodoxy to religious participation are investigated. A literature review and multivariate analysis of Mennonite data suggests: first, that the relationship between socioeconomic status and religious participation may be due to educational rather than economic factors; second, that the oft reported zero-order correlation between orthodoxy of belief and religious participation is probably not spurious; and third, that belief-orthodoxy acts as a suppressor of the education/religious participation relationship."
256;1977;"The syncretism of West African Voodoo with Catholicism and Creole ""gods"" has been well documented on the island of Haiti. The authors affirm that during the time when other Creole elements were being incorporated into Voodoo, the diffusion of a popular theatrical tradition, the commedia dell'arte, facilitated the adoption of dramatic elements which can be seen today. These elements include similar improvisations, costumes, dressing rooms, props, and personalities attributed to ""gods."" Supportive evidence for this affirmation was found by comparing Voodoo cults with theatrical elements to Voodoo in Africa and other regions of Haiti where the commedia dell'arte was not found."
257;1977;This essay addresses the basic question: what criteria should be used in constructing and evaluating scientific definitions of religion? Alternatives are considered and the general criterion of analytical utility is proferred. It is argued that as different definitional strategies are adopted to produce different kinds of knowledge, various criteria must be enjoined in evaluating the various kinds of definitions proposed.
258;1977;This paper examines the social basis of various forms of religious behavior among low income ethnic minority groups. The data suggest that traditional measures of religious behavior are not appropriate to such groups. Three distinct patterns are described and analyzed in terms of their relationship to traditional measures of religiosity.
259;1977;This study presents an alternative explanation of low-income religious behavior other than as a compensation for the conditions of lower-class life or as an escape from those conditions. The argument is made that the religion of the poor contributes in significant and positive ways to the processes of identity formation and to the development and maintenance of cultural values and norms. The immediate social environment of the religious service provides a context in which identities are dynamically and dramatically conferred, developed, and reinforced. With regards to the larger social evnrionment, the religion of the poor, first of all, offers a challenge to the hierarchical structure of the general status system. And, secondly, the religion of the poor offers an understanding of tragedy and suffering that is frequently lacking from the sensibilities of the religious nonpoor.
260;1977;"This study starts from the premise that religions, in all their diversity, rest upon a common structure: the persistent experience of injustice, suffering, and meaninglessness. The research deals with the responses made by 751 persons from five countries to statements suggesting those themes. Three general hypotheses are tested: 1) that interest in questions of injustice, suffering, and meaninglessness would be widespread among this heterogeneous set of respondents; 2) that the problems would be seen as persistent and intractable; 3) that the belief would prevail, nevertheless, that the problems could finally be dealt with, despite the testimony of experience. Each of these hypothese of six predictor variables was upheld. In addition, several specific hypotheses make predictions regarding the influence of these interests and beliefs, country of citizenship, father's occupation, religious identity, sex, level of education, and major subject of study, with country, religious identity, and education producing some effects."
261;1977;"Three of Japan's ""New Religions,"" Soka Gakkai, Rissho Kosei-kai, and PL Kyodan, are making innovative responses to the disintegrating consequences of modernization, particularly the deterioration of the traditional value system. In addition to the re-affirmation of the traditional values of loyalty to religious leaders and aestheticism, the three religions have synthesized traditional and modern values and methods in utilizing technology to achieve their goals. Of greater significance is the emergence of distinctive values and organizational forms which represents a creative reformulation of the Japanese religious tradition on the part of the three New Religions. Despite concern for universal values, the reformulated value system of the three religions is still tied to the particularistic value of Japanese nationalism."
262;1977;Two surveys of white American Protestants and Roman Catholics during 1962 and 1975 asked three questions dealing with the legalization of abortion. The data indicate that there has been a slight Protestant-Catholic decrease in attitudinal differences. Nearly all Protestant categories became more favorable toward abortion. By contrast, the Catholics who became relatively more accepting of abortion were primarily those who were young.
263;1977;Unlike the study of politics, economic development, education, and other dimensions of modern society, little quantitative cross-national research has been done on religion, probably because the necessary data has seemed lacking. Yet a promising source of available data exists: data on religious book publishing which is recorded annually by the United Nations. These data provide an indicator of societal religious commitment for at least 43 countries covering the past quarter century. This paper discusses the quality and validity of these data, showing that they correlate well with several dozen other sources of data of more limited scope. As a measure of secularization, these data appear related in the expected direction to quantitative, cross-national indicators of modernity.
264;1977;Using data from a recent detailed survey of church membership, measures for four important dimensions of religion are developed and used to create a regionalization of American religion. The four measures are Catholics as a percentage of total population, liberal Protestant adherents as a percentage of all Protestants, church members as a percentage of total population, and an index of religious diversity. The statistical regionalization has patterns generally similar to those found on two earlier, largely subjective maps of American religious regions. That the same regions appear under different map compliation strategies reinforces the concept of the religious region. When religious regions are compared with other cultural regionalizations major inconsistencies are found in the western Middle West, in New England, and in the northern Plains.
265;1977;Using data from undergraduate students at a northeastern university, this paper assesses Yinger's non-doctrinal religious items. As with other research, we discovered little internal consistency for the items as an index, and in a factor analysis three factors emerged (value of religious efforts, value of difficult experience, and belief in order and pattern). These three factors were related to several measures of traditional religion, such as belief in God, church attendance, prayer, Bible reading, meditation, and self-rated religiosity.
266;1977;Weber's Protestant ethic thesis is more concerned with a person's beliefs and values than his affiliation per se. To test the thesis, an index of Calvinist beliefs and values was constructed and administered to a randomly selected sample of 252 males in a midwestern rural city. The index was found to correlate positively with both occupational status and educational achievement. But when religious affiliation was used as an independent variable, its relationship to occupational status was found to be minimal. These results suggest that religious affiliation is a less adequate measure of the independent variable in assessing religion's effect upon secular behavior than the religious beliefs suggested by Weber's analysis.
267;1977;Women in Chile have taken considerable responsibility for the pastoral concerns of the Catholic Church. Some are administrators of parishes, while many more have almost total responsibility for the religious formation of adults and children. Many of these services would not function without these women due to the growing scarcity of priests. Research has shown that these women have developed a more modern post conciliar view as opposed to their former heavily folk-religious attitudes and beliefs and to the views of some Bishops. While these women in accepting pastoral responsibility for the future of the Church are not intentionally out to change Church structure or invade the clerical ranks, the values and procedures of the ecclesiastical structure are being transformed and modified by their involvement.
268;1978;Based on 1976 national survey data it was found that frequency of church attendance is positively related to disapproval of legalized abortion for members of fundamentalist churches. However, unlike previously reported studies, no relationship exists between church attendance and attitudes toward abortion for members of liberal churches. The reason proposed for the difference lies in the different orientations and concerns that have historically characterized fundamentalist and liberal churches.
269;1978;"Content analysis and subsequent profile analysis of 120 letters received in response to an appeal published in Australian newspapers for views on the experience of glossolalia yielded six distinct groups. Group I (N = 29) involved non-crisis experiences, glossolalia in private, belief in the experience as confirming baptism in the Spirit; Group II (N = 14) involved crisis experience, experienced glossolalia in a group setting and held a belief that the experience was an optional extra; Group III (N = 27) gave an objective, non-fluent, non-emotional description of the experience; Group IV (N = 10) reported a crisis experience; were evenly divided between group and private manifestations, believed in its necessity, ineffability, were fluent and emotional. The remaining groups comprised letters from non-glossolalics. It is concluded that the experience of glossolalia is not unitary, and that it does not necessarily involve an altered state of consciousness."
270;1978;Durkheim had argued that Protestantism decreased homicidal tendencies while Catholicism tended to increase it. However, other writers have maintained that fundamental Protestantism may increase the tendency toward homicide. This study examines the question by relating religious affiliation data by race obtained from a 1916 Census Department study to homicidal rates in the rural South for 1920, and finds that both Protestant and Catholic affiliations for whites are related to less homicide, while for blacks religious affiliation is unrelated to the homicide rate. For the case of the South, these results tend to refute Durkheim's position that Catholicism increases the tendency toward homicide.
271;1978;French religious research remains particularly interested in socio-historical studies and theoretical debates, especially centered around the classics. Research on individual socio-religious behavior has evolved toward previously neglected dimensions and the structure of religion as a system of meanings, particularly in the analysis of religious language. In socio-ecclesiastical research, trends emphasize the study of the division of religious labor, the power structure, and the social and cultural strategies of the various agents in the religious field. Finally, with regard to religion and society, research focuses on the social, political, and ideological functions of religions and religious groups.
272;1978;"Goldman's hypothesized factors for facilitating or impeding development of religious thinking were assessed using data from 10th graders in suburban Catholic, Baptist, and Methodist churches. The role of overall cognitive capacity was less than Goldman suggested, and the role of religious training was greater. The impact of religious education varied widely across denominations. Goldman's theory that a gap between concrete religious thinking and higher-level cognitive functioning in other areas tends to produce faith rejection was not supported; the results, except for the private school Catholics, were just the opposite--more abstract religious thinking is associated with greater rejection of doctrine and the church."
273;1978;Ideas from Kai T. Erikson and Guy E. Swanson are brought together to account for the appearance of political witch-hunts like the Chinese Cultural Revolution. Erikson's idea of a boundary crisis and Swanson's notion of immanence are used to account for the highly religious overtones to these events. The American threat in Vietnam is identified as a threat to the Chinese and the purges and rectification campaigns of the Cultural Revolution are seen as Durkheimian efforts at reaffirming the collective identity of the Chinese nation. The idea of the sacred and the profane is shown to be similar to the notion of deviant and normal. Both, it is argued, are symbolic oppositions to collective purposes that are created by collectivities to renew their corporate existence.
274;1978;Members of the Jesus movement in Johannesburg, South Africa, were presented with Brown and Lowe's Inventory of Religious Belief and the Wilson-Patterson Conservatism Scale. These were completed so as to reflect the respondents' past and present attitudes. The respondents were Caucasian, English-speaking young men and women between the ages of 17 and 28. The control group, comprised of members of mainstream-church denominations, was matched with the Jesus People for age, home-language, occupation of father, and general intelligence. Results indicated that, as a consequence of their conversion, the Jesus People became more Biblically fundamentalistic, and less conservative, less militaristic, less antihedonistic, and less ecclesiastically fundamentalistic. There were no changes in their degree of ethnocentrism and realism.
275;1978;Several dimensions of religious commitments have been proposed and studied in the sociology of religion. These are taken as empirical generalizations which may be applicable to politics. Results of data from a metropolitan sample are factored, obliquely rotated, and interpreted. As hypothesized, corresponding sets of dimensions result for religious and political variables. Rather than the five dimensions originally sought, six are considered to be more in line with the empirical results. Although the first order dimensions show religious and political parallels, distinct second order arrangements were found. Relationships among commitment dimensions both within and between the religious and political spheres are also examined.
276;1978;Several of the underlying conceptions and the assumptions on which the late nineteenth century world view of science was built--which often underly religious research--are being called into question in the wake of empirical discoveries and theoretical ideas of contemporary science. This paper suggests that the implications of these developments for redefining intellectual postures of science and religion concerning each other and themselves need to be reviewed if the science study of religion is to go forward on carefully considered grounds.
277;1978;"Studies in the United States show that ""ecstatic,"" ""paranormal,"" or ""religious experience is much more widespread than contemporary descriptions of reality would lead us to suppose. Despite differences in methodology, trends seem to be emerging and a recent national survey in Great Britain suggests that these findings may not be peculiar to North America. The paper outlines points of convergence and divergence between the British and American work on the occurrance of such experience and its relation to psychological well-being, and explores theoretical perspectives which may illuminate the information gathered in these surveys."
278;1978;The application parameters of Kelley's thesis concerning Conservative church growth are examined from a recent Canadian national survey. Utilizing a basic demographic approach, the Conservative and Mainline groups had essentially the same proportion of proselytes, and the superior Conservative growth was related to: (1) birth and religious socialization, (2) switching, and (3) a higher level of participation. Kelley's thesis is seen as a plausible explanation for these retention patterns, but as having limited merit with respect to the proselytizing of people outside of the Christian community.
279;1978;The development of scales designed to measure the moral and religious beliefs of Catholic adolescents in U.K. secondary schools is outlined. Responses to 67 items, using a sample of 1,284 students, describing moral and religious issues associated with an innovatory curriculum project in the humanities furnished eight groups of items which were scaled by the method of reciprocal averages. Six of these item clusters were retained as scales and five of them significantly discriminated between externally defined criterion groups who differed in moral orientation. The structure of the moral belief domain mapped by the six scales is relatively well defined by two components termed moral conservatism and moral liberalism.
280;1978;The effect of anticipatory set stress and setting stress on reports of mystical experience was investigated in solitary nature experiences. Ninety-three persons participating in a solo experience were categorized into high and low anticipatory stress, and according to whether the setting stress was high or low. As predicted, set/setting stress incongruities elicited greater reports of mystical experience than set/setting congruencies. In addition, persons indicating greater reports of mystical experience showed greater positive self regards on the ACL than persons indicating less mystical experience or persons not completing the mystical experience measure.
281;1978;"The intrinsic and extrinsic scales were used to create four categories of religious orientation: intrinsic, indiscriminately pro, extrinsic, and indiscriminately anti. Specific a priori preductions concerning differences between the two indiscriminate categories as well as ""post hoc"" analyses of differences between all four categories were investigated. Predicted differences were obtained for various indices of religious manifestation (reported mystical experience, differential recall of religious humor, and differential approach to religious stimuli) as well as for measures indicating assumed conflict (stress as measured by voice tremors and repression-sensitization) among the indiscriminates."
282;1978;The previously reported negative correlation between intrinsic religion and racial prejudice could be an artifact of social desirability. To test this proposition, 51 undergraduates interested in religion participated in a study. Racial prejudice was measured in two ways, in a standard questionnaire session and in a situation where responses had clear behavioral consequences. Consistent with previous research, intrinsic religion correlated negatively with the questionnaire measure of prejudice. But as expected, intrinsic religion also correlated positively with a measure of social desirability. When the effects of social desirability were controlled, the negative correlation between intrinsic religion and prejudice either diminished (psychometric control) or disappeared (behavioral control). Another orientation to religion, religion as quest, correlated negatively with racial prejudice even when social desirability was controlled.
283;1978;"The purpose of this study is to examine professional identification, especially as it relates to the role support provided by role partners. Respondents were members of the student body of an American catholic seminary for parish priests. As expected in the tentative model, ""identification"" as a priest (measured by self-report) was a function of ""career progress"" (measured as time in training), ""role practice"" (e.g., having one's counsel sought), and ""significant other influence"" (measured as relating to various role partners providing differential ""role support""). All these coincide with official sacramental rituals or rites of status-transition. Though the priesthood is not so dominant a profession as is medicine, student-priests are like student-physicians in these particulars. Unlike the practicing physician, the assistant pastor appears to depend on rather than determine the setting in which he works, probably continuing to rely on his superiors and on the laity to confirm his professional identity."
284;1978;The study explored types and incidence of intense experiences reported by normal adults. A structured question developed by Greeley (1974) and an open-ended question asking respondents to describe their experiences were completed by 302 young adults. A third of the respondents indicated on the structured item that they had had an intense spiritual experience, a percentage similar to that found by Greeley with a national sample. Content analysis of the open-ended responses showed these to include classical mystical experiences, irrelevant or trivial experiences, psychic experiences, and Faith and Consolation experiences. The findings reaffirm the need for more careful development of measurement techniques before conclusions about the incidence of mystical experiences can be reached.
285;1978;To the traditional variables of denomination and theological position as explanations of clergy behavior is added the variable of clergy authority. In addition to measuring authority, we identified the kinds of clergy who manifest its several forms, and investigated some of authority's effects. Authority made an independent contribution to understanding clergy behavior in the areas of formality of churchmanship, political liberalism, social involvement, and involvement in professional role activities.
286;1978;Tolerance, growth, commitment, cooperation, and agreement are examples of beliefs and behaviors that separate lines of past research have found to be related to satisfaction in marriage and to pro-religiosity. Because of this dual finding measures of pro-religiosity and measures of marital adjustment and satisfaction were hypothesized to be positively correlated. The quality of marriage of 64 couples was measured with the Locke-Wallace Marital Adjustment Scale (LWMAS) and other single item measures of spouses' satisfaction with their marriage. Seventeen measures of religiosity were included. The results confirm the hypothesis. Discussion suggests ways in which quality of marriage may express the religiosity of the spouses.
287;1978;Turner and Killian have suggested that the tendency for internal movements of dissent to become incorporated into their parent organizations, rather than separating from them, depends largely on the degree of integration of their members into the parent body, the power of that body to enforce its position and to suppress dissent, and its ability to absorb dissent through reform or structural differentiation. Our case studies of Neo-Pentecostal movements in two established churches support the Turner and Killian theory but indicate the need for its extension. Drawing on these studies and recent theories of movement development, we specify more fully the types of movement-organization relationships which may emerge and indicate the characteristics of movements, their parent organizations, and their mutual interactions that may be expected to lead to the various types of relationships.
288;1978;Two studies were carried out to investigate the frequently reported tendency for university students to become less orthodox in their religious beliefs and practices over the course of their college years. The first was primarily a cross-sectional study of 457 University of Manitoba students, while the second was a two and a half year longitudinal investigation of 212 Wilfrid Laurier University students. The single consistent finding in these projects was a tendency for seniors to report attending church less frequently than freshmen. Otherwise, limited evidence was found (either overall or for major denominational groupings) of the supposed trend away from orthodoxy over a variety of questionnaire items relating to religious beliefs, practices and reactions to parental religious teachings. These results appear compatible with the related literature.
289;1978;Using questionnaire data from members of eight suburban Protestant churches, deprivation, child rearing, doctrinal beliefs, and status group theories of church commitment and participation were tested. Dependent variables included church attendance, organizational participation, dollars contributed, and percent of income contributed. The deprivation theory was not supported. The child rearing theory, saying that parents with school-age children participate more, found some support. Doctrinal beliefs had a definite impact, but was only moderately strong when other variables were controlled. The status group theory was supported. Future theorizing about participation in mainline Protestant churches should begin with an analysis of motivations generated by church life itself. The status group and localism theories seem hopeful starting points.
290;1978;"We interviewed 451 (Catholic, Southern Baptist, and Methodist) tenth graders in three denominations. To identify determinants of church attendance, church youth group participation, attitudes toward the church, and attitudes toward church youth programs, predictor variables included family factors, peer group pressures, program and leadership factors, and beliefs. The principal determinants were parents' church attendance for church attendance; peer pressures and types of leaders for youth group participation and attitudes toward youth groups; and past religious education, types of leaders, and beliefs for overall attitudes toward the church. In fostering church commitment among the youth, personal relationships have been foremost--relationships with parents, peers, and church leaders. The Baptist youth had stronger church commitment and involvement than the others, a pattern explainable by denominational differences on several crucial determinants."
291;1978;"While Max Weber formulated an ""ideal"" definition of charisma and its routinization, he did not fully address the question of charismatic origins. This paper proposes a theory of charismatic leadership which explores the social conditions under which charisma will emerge. Charismatic leaders are hypothesized to live in periods of radical social change or be cut off from the mainstream of society, perceive religious tradition as relative, and have innovative teachings if their religion is to be institutionalized. They are also not excluded from occupying an institutional office within a traditional religion. The theory is tentatively supported by an examination of biographical data for fifteen charismatic leaders and their successors from various periods of history and from different parts of the world."
292;1978;"Wuthnow (1976) contends that secularization in the United States has been a ""discontinuous"" process marked by dramatic fluctuations in religious commitment. This brief paper undertakes an empirical assessment of the discontinuity thesis. When Wuthnow's indicators of religious commitment are expanded, refined, and reanalyzed, it is not clear that secularization has been discontinuous during this century. Of the seven indicators examined, four exhibit linear trends. The paper concludes with suggestions for further investigation of this emerging issue in secularization theory."
293;1978;Youth in fundamentalist religious homes sometimes reject the faith of their parents. What variables correlate with alienation from religion in adolescents? Multiple regression analysis of 400 high school students indicated that alienation from religion in Seventh-day Adventist adolescents is correlated with the quality of their relationships with parents and other religious authority figures, especially as these relationships concern religious values. A strong relationship was also found between alienation and inconsistency between profession and practice reported by youth in the lives of their religious teachers. A moderate relationship was found between alienation and the concept of religion held by the adolescent.
294;1979;"A ""charismatic"" and a ""mainline"" Presbyterian congregation in the same geographic area and whose members show similar socioeconomic and demographic characteristics were compared in order to analyze religious commitment. Commitment is conceptualized in terms of meaning and belonging, and various measures are suggested for operationalizing the concepts. It is found that the charismatic congregation has stronger commitment and that it does so because it is more effective at providing meaning and belonging to its members through stronger closure, strictness, consensus on authority, and cohesion. In addressing the relative importance of meaning versus belonging, it is found that both are highly salient but that belonging is perhaps more central than is usually suggested in the literature. The findings have relevance for the current debate over the reasons for the growth of conservative churches: It is suggested that social structure, or community, is as important as doctrinal stance in explaining their growth."
295;1979;A typology of religious experience was developed based on interviews (N = 45) with individuals claiming to have had religious experiences. Subjects' accounts were content-analyzed to extract the major attributes of the experience. These attributes were then factor-analyzed to determine the number of distinctively different types of the religious experience. A total of four factors were extracted, each descriptive of a distinct type of religious experience.
296;1979;Angyal's theory that personality types can be differentiated on the basis of autonomy and homonomy was used as a framework for studying psychodynamic differences between 50 feminist and 45 nonfeminist university women. In addition to Allport's Religious Orientation Inventory (ROI), the subjects were also administered three other personality tests. Discriminant function analysis was applied to the Allport scales and to 17 scales from the other three tests (7 expressive of autonomy and 10 expressive of homonomy). The feminists scored significantly higher on the 7 autonomy scales and nonfeminists significantly higher on the 10 homonomy and on the ROI Intrinsic scale. In the prediction equation generated by discriminant analysis, the ROI Intrinsic scale had a loading predominantly higher than that of any other scale. The discussion of the results pointed out their consistency with the theoretical model.
297;1979;Control is the process of influencing the behavior of a person, group, or organization. This paper examines the determinants of amount and distribution of control in local churches. Causal variables include denominational polity, size of denomination, minister's tenure, minister's attitudes, members' average income, and size/complexity of the local church. Several of these variables are found to be related to control, but denominational characteristics--especially size of denomination--are most strongly related. Our findings suggest that denominational effects on control involve both the dependence of the local church on the denomination and members' preferences regarding control.
298;1979;"Durkheim imposed his own totemic or ordering principle on the interpretation of Australian religion. Unfortunately his frame of reference did not fit well, and as a result the data received short shrift. In fact, totems are assigned to six relatively independent, salient units of social organization: tribe, moiety, clan, manhood, femalehood, and personhood. Totems reinforce boundaries around each of these ""identities,"" but since Durkheim's focus on social solidarity demanded harmonious interlocking, he overlooked the tension between these units of social organization. The data fit better in a model which stresses sacralization of various intertwining and conflicting units. The model employs sacralization not just in terms of: (a) objectification (i.e., the totem sums up a particular order), but also: (b) commitment (i.e., asceticism and sacrifice reinforce salient loyalties), (c) ritual (i.e., initiation strengthens manhood), and (d) myth (i.e., territorial myths reinforce tribal identity). The alternative account is then linked to territoriality as a pre-eminent means for primate adaptation."
299;1979;Eighty-two males from a religious group of men located in midwestern United States rated themselves on three religious attitude scales to determine their particular orientations on a literal-symbolic continuum of religious commitment according to Hunt. These eighty-two subjects were next rated by three peer associates on these same three religious attitudes but using scales composed of the definitions of these attitudes. The results of these two assessment procedures were correlated and arranged according to Campbell and Fiske's technique for determining convergent and discriminant construct validity. The literal and mythological scales were found to possess significant convergent validities of .43 and .38, respectively.
300;1979;"On the basis of a social contextual model this paper hypothesizes: first, a positive relationship between adolescent self-esteem and religiosity across twelve purposive, middle-class, Catholic, samples from cities in five cultures: New York and St. Paul; Merida, Yucatan; San Juan, Puerto Rico; Seville, Spain; and Bonn, West Germany; and second, on the basis of traditional sex-role theory, a stronger relationship between the two variables is hypothesized for females than for males. The findings yield consistent support for the first hypothesis, and mild support for the second in the Latin samples only. The cross-cultural support for the first is underscored and speculation concerning the apparent contradictory evidence for sex-role theories is offered. The emergence of a Latin/non-Latin dichotomy is discussed. Suggested expansions of the topic include motivational and church-sect issues."
301;1979;One hundred thirty-three Protestant, Jewish and Roman Catholic church and synagogue members from twelve congregations completed a battery of religiosity and psychosocial competence scales. The dimensions of religiosity and psychosocial competence were significantly related. Attendance at religious services was associated with sets of psychosocial benefits and tradeoffs. Intrinsic religiously motivated members, in general, manifested more favorable competence attributes than less intrinsically motivated members. The interactions between the dimensions of religiosity were also meaningful for the psychosocial competence of the member. Variations in participation and motivation had similar psychosocial meaning for Protestants, Jews and Catholics. These results point to the important implications of religiosity for the full range of human functioning, a range which includes strengths and resources as well as deficits.
302;1979;"Recent large scale studies of reports of ""religious experience"" have the shortcoming that they give only limited indications of the substantive content of such experience. This paper presents a descriptive account of reports of religious experience amongst a random sample of post-graduate students. A very high proportion of students claimed experience, and their statements were found to have certain consistent characteristics and to be amenable to classification. It seems possible that by taking descriptions of this kind seriously, some problems in the scientific study of religion may receive clarification."
303;1979;Religious ritual is a woefully neglected area of research in the psychology of religion. The major theorists (Freud and James) considered ritual an inferior form of religious expression. However, theoretical grounds for a more positive view of religious ritual exist. Erik H. Erikson's theory sees ritual as a form of religious activity that is inherently adaptive. This study applies Erikson's theory of ritual to the excommunication proceedings carried out by First Church of Boston against Ann Hibbens in 1640. I argue that these proceedings were a judicial type ritual whose psychosocial dynamic was autonomy vs. shame and self-doubt. I judge the trial to be maladaptive because it was excessively legalistic. Erikson's theory not only provides a rationale for this negative assessment of the trial, but also it enables us to recommend an alternative form of ritual action that would have been adaptive. The study concludes with suggestions for relating Erikson's ritual elements and types of religious authority.
304;1979;The application of a symbolic interactionist approach to the phenomenon of the spiritual exercises of Saint Ignatius Loyola suggests that individuals engage in this experience in an attempt to reconcile conflicting self-systems that arise in disparate social situations. A study of forty-six Jesuit novices was conducted over a four-month period, during which novices underwent intensive spiritual exercises. Results of the analysis confirm that the thirty-day initiatory experience did have a significant integrative effect on the self-systems of individuals in the sample.
305;1979;"The association between religiosity and prejudice was evaluated, using a sample of 152 Greek Americans from Cincinnati, Ohio. Several indicators of religiosity, such as church membership, church attendance, parochial education, and orthodoxy were used. The findings showed little support for the recurrent inverse associations between church membership or orthodoxy and tolerance, except for the negative association between orthodoxy and stereotype Negro tolerance. Furthermore, the effects of religiosity (orthodoxy) varied with authoritarianism, being positive among authoritarians and negative among non-authoritarians. Parochial education was associated only with positive images about blacks and showed an interaction with general education when the latter was controlled. The ritual indicators and church attendance were positively associated with tolerance; and the renowned curvilinear trend was observed only for Negro social distance, although it was not statistically significant. Introducing an ethnicity factor to the church attendance and orthodoxy analyses produced results somewhat more consistent with American studies and also gave some support to the Gorsuch and Aleshire (1974) social conformity interpretation. Differences in results between this and other studies were attributed to operational, regional, and cultural differences. It was suggested that the cultural and social conformity hypotheses could best be tested by using ethnic generations."
306;1979;The dimensions of freedom are examined as they relate to life in the monastery. Monks, when compared to other groups, are found to score low on ego freedom and conditional freedom, but high on disciplined freedom. The impact of disciplined freedom on the level of cohesion, alienation, and deprivation of freedom are examined, and the monks are found to be high on cohesion and low on alienation and deprivation of freedom. This is true despite their isolation and difficult regimen. Additionally, the dimensions of freedom are directly related to cohesion and negatively related to alienation and deprivation of freedom. The reverse is true with ego and conditional freedom. The implications of disciplined freedom on monastery life are discussed.
307;1979;"The evolution of the cosmology, social organization, and practices of a modern ""Church of Magic,"" as well as the social and psychological characteristics of its members, were examined to determine whether the organization more closely approximated the white, middle class ""Occult Establishment"" described by Martin Marty, or whether it resembled a ""deviant perspective"" which attracted ""deviant individuals"" as suggested by Lofland and Stark. The findings confirmed Marty's description in that the evolution of the belief system, organization, and magical practices of the Church reflected the maturation of the wider ""Occult Establishment"" in the United States during the late 1960's. However, the model of conversion to a deviant perspective outlined by Lofland and Stark proved useful, not only in noting the emergence of a ""deviant perspective"" within the Church of the Sun, but also in examining the psychological and social-situational factors which led to adherence to a relatively conventional perspective and praxis. In theoretical and comparative perspective, the members of the Church of the Sun are like those in several other occult and new religious groups, seeking a deeper, more mystical, and more complex understanding of their individual identities within the context of modern ""mass society."" They also often gain a powerful sense of community from their participation in collective ritual."
308;1979;"The question of the relationship between modern industrialization and religiosity is examined in the Canadian setting, using data from the first national survey of religion in that country. The vast majority of Canadians are found to raise ultimate questions, but for most, such questions appear to be secondary rather than primary concerns. While perhaps two in five people give evidence of being inclined toward traditional Christianity, the New Religions, or being otherwise religiously committed, the majority appear to adopt no religion--old or new, but instead have a fragmented, ""unfocused"" orientation toward meaning. Accordingly, despite raising questions of meaning, the dominant tendency among Canadians is to be resigned to their unanswerability. A consideration of the state of organized religion and some of the correlates of industrialization leads to the conclusion that religiosity in Canada is in a state of recession which seems unlikely to reverse itself in the foreseeable future."
309;1979;The relationship of fear of death to Intrinsic and Extrinsic religious commitment was studied in Christian and Buddhist populations to test the hypothesis that these relationships are consistent across widely differing philosophico-religious traditions. Subjects were 91 members of one Buddhist, one Congregationalist and three Southern Baptist churches in Honolulu, Hawaii. Fear of death was negatively related to Intrinsic religion and positively related to Extrinsic religion only for Christian respondents, suggesting the inapplicability of the Intrinsic-Extrinsic dimension for Buddhists. Christian groups reported significantly less fear of death and significantly more positive attitudes about death than did Buddhists, suggesting that religious traditions vary in the effectiveness with which they assist their members in confronting death.
310;1979;"The role that deviant religions can play in the processes of cultural evolution has been largely overlooked by anthropologists. Among the Aymara Indians of Peru, a once ostricized and persecuted group of Seventh Day Adventists has assumed leadership as the community system is transformed from a subsistence agriculture economy to a money economy. To explain this emergence of a Protestant elite in a predominantly Catholic society, a ""Weberian"" hypothesis, based on a causal relation between Protestantism and capitalism, is tested and rejected. An alternative hypothesis, based on the adaptive value of deviance in the evolutionary process, proves more in accord with the data. It is shown that deviant religion, while not a primary cause of cultural evolution, may be a powerful directive force."
311;1979;There has been an assumption that Australia is a Christian country, and consequently little attention has been given to studying those Australians who repudiate the conventional denominational allegiances or who regard themselves as secularists. This paper examines some of the measures which indicate what proportion of the population they constitute. It also attempts a social and demographic profile which suggests that Australian secularists have at least some of the characteristics of an identifiable sub-culture in the society.
312;1979;This essay examines changes in the geographical distributions of the American Jewish population between 1952 and 1971, and the role of that population in emerging patterns of religious pluralism in the United States. It is found that American Jews have increased their numbers substantially in areas of the country not traditionally associated with Jewish residence. Despite this shift, the Jewish population remains highly concentrated in metropolitan area counties. Moreover, regardless of size, Jewish communities are overwhelmingly situated in geographic areas marked by high levels of religious pluralism. The implications of these findings for an understanding of the minority status of American Jews and their position in the scheme of American pluralism are discussed.
313;1979;"This paper constructs a set of concepts needed for a theory of religious movements. First, the boundaries for such a theory are set by defining religion and then by translating this definition into terms more useful for theorizing. Next, we demonstrate why a faulty understanding of ""ideal types"" has led to conceptualizations of church and sect that prevent theorizing. We adopt Benton Johnson's solution for defining the underlying church-sect axis. In the remainder of the paper we show that the concepts of church and sect are not adequate to encompass the full range of religious movements. The concept of cult is introduced, clarified, and then delimited to exclude cults that fall short of constituting religious movements. Throughout, we molest a variety of sacred cows."
314;1979;This paper deals with an issue much discussed since the time of Max Weber in social science literature: the relationship between Protestantism and socio-economic development. Data from a Mexican Indian municipality whose members have recently experienced mass conversion to Protestantism are presented to give a non-Western perspective on Weber's thesis. The resultant socio-economic changes are discussed in terms of alleviating three major problems of any underdeveloped Indian community: poverty, disease, and illiteracy. After dealing with the history of conversion and community development, the question of why conversion took place is discussed by identifying the relevant socio-economic, cultural, and other factors. Finally, the question of how conversion became the catalyst for community development is discussed, focusing on the implications of the conversion experience, its confirmation, and the resultant value orientation changes.
315;1979;This paper examines the switching of religious preferences among Protestants in the seventies. The NORC General Social Surveys data indicate: (a) little support for Stark and Glock's switching model, and (b) considerable diversity in switching such as shifts of the upwardly mobile to status churches, of others to conservative and fringe groups, and sizable proportions away from religious identification. An alternative model utilizing a mainline -- fringe distinction is proposed for describing these trends, and for illuminating the cultural meanings associated with religious preference.
316;1979;This research focuses on the relationship of several measures of religiosity with one multidimensional and two unidimensional fear of death scales. Questionnaire data were analyzed for 375 undergraduates at a midwestern university. Results showed that seven of the eight multidimensional fear of death subscales correlated significantly with at least one of the religiosity measures. No significant correlations were found between religiosity and the two unidimensional fear of death scales. Results suggest that religiosity may serve to reduce certain fears of death while increasing other death-related fears, depending on whether the fears are dealt with directly by religious belief.
317;1979;"This research note looks at persons who were raised with no religious group identification, and compares those who remain ""nones"" with those who have come to identify with some religious body. Those who remain ""nones"" appear more liberal in political and moral values, and more ""worldly"" in their lifestyles. Those who later identify with organized religion tend to be more satisfied with where they live and their friends. Interestingly, persons who have moved to a new state, county, or town are much more likely to have left the ""none"" category. This latter tendency was especially true of those raised in rural areas and small towns, and is the only finding in which the causal direction is relatively clear."
318;1979;"This study examines the internal structure of the Roman Catholic priesthood and the consequences structural differences have for priests' religious perspectives, professional attitudes, and the way they live. Comparisons between diocesan and religious order clergy reveal distinct patterns of influence operating within these separate organizational units. The diocesan structure approximates an exchange model of goal integration; the religious order, an accommodation model. However, differences in basic beliefs and values are found in both structures; these differences provide insight into the dilemmas confronting the present transitional nature of the priest-profession as a whole."
319;1979;This study reviews an old problem in a new situation. It seeks to assess the influence of the priest administrator on expressed attitude towards religion among nine and ten year old students. A significant difference is found in the direction of increased score falsification when the test is administered by a priest.
320;1979;Using data from four yearly probability surveys (1972-1975) in a deep-south city, an effort is made to explore the feasibility of deterrence theory for understanding how involvement in Protestant religious subcultures affects drunken driving. Among the more religious respondents, fundamentalists are more likely than others to believe there is a higher risk of receiving specific sanctions for dunken driving. This relationship is strongest among males, the better educated, and respondents over 35. To the extent that these differences in fear of sanctions are linked to variations in deviant conduct, deterrence theory is a promising approach for understanding the consequences of religion for deviance.
321;1980;A model of monetary contributions to religious organizations is developed using a public goods framework. Results for the linear regression model using data from nineteen Protestant denominations show the importance of monitoring in explaining variations in the level of giving.
322;1980;According to the myth-ritualist theory, religion is primitive science: through myth and ritual, which operate together and constitute its core, religion magically manipulates the world. Many of the leading theories of religion present alternative views of the relationship and function of myths and rituals. Even if false, the myth-ritualist theory is valuable in suggesting aspects of religion which might otherwise get overlooked. Similarly, charting its alternatives suggests other aspects of religion which might also be missed.
323;1980;By examining the effect of modernization on the frequency of fasting, and the prevalence of various reasons for fasting, we attempted to gain insight into the nature of contemporary religious change. Using data from a stratified random sample of Javanese, we found that fasting was not consistently related to all indicators of modernization. However it does seem that the frequency of fasting will increase on Java, at least in the near future. Further, we found modernization to be associated with a decline in fasting as an expression of piety and an increase in fasting for the purpose of self-control. The data were interpreted in light of the history of fasting and the theoretical perspectives of Hocart and Peacock.
324;1980;Ceremonial trance behavior is a private religious experience that occurs in a public setting. Sociologists have long concerned themselves with the distinction between individual reactions to external stimuli and social behavior. While trance states may be individual responses, they also involve subtle forms of social interaction and are dependent upon the context in which they occur. The repetitive format of ritual activities can trigger and help to sustain trance behaviors. Data for this analysis of religious experiences in public settings are drawn from audio and video recordings of worship services among the African Apostles, an indigenous African church. Members' own accounts of the trance states are examined in concert with the recorded materials in order to gain insight into the subjective and social interpretations of collective religious experience.
325;1980;Contrary to the widespread popular belief that conversion is a radical change of personality, this article offers the alternative view of conversion and commitment as being evolutionary in their development. Based on intensive interviews with the followers of Guru Maharaj Ji, the guru of Divine Light Mission, it traces the stages and steps followers took in becoming devotees. Examined sequentially, these stages and steps are viewed as a theoretical structure for the comparative analysis of other religious movements and the stages are briefly compared to the theory of conversion offered by Lofland and Stark.
326;1980;Despite the theoretical importance of the distinction between members and nonmembers of religious groups, the concept of membership has received insufficient attention in research. Too often subjective identification with a religious group has been treated as identical with actual affililation. In order to examine both subjective and objective membership, we use data from the National Jewish Population Survey to contrast the impact of denominational identification and actual synagogue membership. This comparison is achieved through the use of a set of dummy variable multiple regression equations. In general, denominational identification is related to those features of Jewish life which occur outside an institutional framework, while actual synagogue membership is associated with public worship, children's Jewish education, and activities in Jewish voluntary associations. Denominational identification is indicative of a broad, communal orientation toward Judaism, the Jewish, and the non-Jewish communities. Moreover, it is associated with people's choice of the specific type of synagogue with which they affiliate. Synagogue membership, in turn, heightens involvement with the institutional aspects of Jewish life. While these findings apply directly to American Jews, analogous relationships ought to be found among American Christians.
327;1980;Eighty two members of a Southern Baptist Church participated in a study of the effects of preaching (P) and preaching supplemented by dialogue (PD). Five instruments were developed as measures: a knowledge test, a pseudo-behavior test, a subjective evaluative test of the subject as a worshipper, a subjective evaluation of the preacher, and a Semantic Differential test related by subject matter to the sermons. The Semantic Differential was the only instrument which showed consistent, significant (p < .05) effects.
328;1980;Field observations and interviews with possessed individuals in contemporary Trinidadian society indicate that the incorporation of the local folklore and superstition is the prime prerequisite for the possession complex, but that the reaction per se is triggered by situations of unusual stress or emotional conflict. Although a consistent clinical picture of psychopathology is not apparent, the four reported case histories consistently reflect a tendency toward hysterical features, sometimes in conjunction with neurotic depression. In all cases, however, possession affords two positive advantages to the individual--direct escape from a conflict situation and diminution of guilt by projecting blame on to the intruding spirit.
329;1980;Four measures of religiosity drawn from the NORC General Social Survey, 1972-1977 (N = 1493 @ 65+) were examined to determine how well they predicted thirteen self-report questions on personal well-being, life satisfaction, and world-view of elderly persons. Only the measure of FREQUENCY OF CHURCH ATTENDANCE--which may be more closely tied to physical health than to religious feeling--resulted in consistent associations with well-being, especially among older women and whites. By contrast, BELIEF IN LIFE AFTER DEATH was shown to be a much stronger and more discriminating predictor of both well-being and Weltanschauung.
330;1980;"Functional explanations of religious phenomena, as offered particularly by anthropologists, have been subjected to a variety of philosophical criticisms. The chief of these can be found in an essay by Carl Hempel. The present paper attempts to assess these criticisms by examining in their light two recent functional accounts of religious phenomena, Roy Rappaport's ""Pigs for the Ancestors"" and I. M. Lewis' ""Ecstatic Religion."" It is concluded that the functional explanations under consideration are best understood as answering questions about how certain religious phenomena could possibly occur rather than about why they occur. If understood this way, functionalism is a valuable tool for the explanation of religion."
331;1980;"In Experiment 1 an experimental analog was developed to an apparent context effect, in which a performance that arouses little excitement when performed by a magician may induce occult beliefs when performed by an alleged ""psychic."" An accomplice presented three common magician's tricks, which resembled ""psychic"" performances, to six introductory psychology classes. In the two classes comprising the Psychic condition, the instructors skeptically introduced the accomplice as an alleged psychic; in the Weak Magic condition, as an amateur magician; in the Strong Magic condition, as an amateur magician who would perform stunts which resembled psychic phenomena, but were really not. Belief was assessed through free-form written response, in the form of feedback to the performer. These instructional sets succeeded in manipulating proportion of occult belief. However, proportion of occult belief was above 50% and far exceeding magic beliefs in each experimental condition, even though, as indicated by a manipulation check, subjects in the Magic conditions heard and understood the instructors' assertions that the accomplice was a magician who would be faking a psychic performance. In paper-and-pencil tests in Experiments 2 and 3, where the performance was verbally described, different instructional sets which were similar to those of Experiment 1 but which reminded subjects explicitly of the logical plausibility of the trickery hypothesis, were presented in a within-S and a between-S design. In analogy with Experiment 1, psychic belief was prevalent and only slightly reduced by logically contradictory information. It was concluded that prevalent prior belief accounted for the tendency to ascribe psychic powers to the performer, and that reasoning fallacies accounted for the resistance of belief to a variety of disconfirming cognitive inputs."
332;1980;"In this paper a theory relevant to understanding the decrease in religious homogeneity is developed and tested. The theoretical model is based on Wuthnow's (1978) analysis of conditions necessary for cultural innovation, with modifications suggested by Lofland and Stark's (1965) research and studies of secularization. The data come from a stratified random sample of Javanese residents. In this context the model was used to predict the prevalance of two types of religious deviants -- Christians and ""nones."" The theory was partially supported by the data. The paper concludes with suggestions for improving the theoretical model."
333;1980;Numerous reports from dissident sources suggest a popular demise of Marxist-Leninist ideology in the Brezhnev era. This growing ideological vacuum has inspired former believers openly to display their beliefs, while former atheists are searching for new values in religious credos. The growing dissent from numerous religious groups against Soviet state atheism testifies to this religious renaissance. Yet like other social groups engaged in practical politics, religious collectivities are successful to the extent that they mobilize and display their political power. An analysis of ninetynine protest demonstrations conducted by seven religious groups in the Soviet Union in 1965-78 reveals that costs tend to be lowest and benefits highest when participants manifest a high level of ideological and physical strength. Likewise, outcomes tend to be more favorable when the regime is ideologically and physically weak.
334;1980;"One focus of the interpretive sociology of religion is the way religious institutions teach persons to organize their experience into relevant moral categories. Applying Goffman's frame analysis to pseudo confessions collected by Italian journalists posing as ""penitents,"" we discover three main frames used to decide whether actions are ""sins,"" and whether priests should give absolution. The frames are the Supernatural-Social, the Supernatural-Individual, and the Natural-Social. Orthodox confessors emphasize the Supernatural-Social frame, while pastoral confessors rely on the Supernatural-Individual Frame, and both would agree that the Natural-Social Frame by itself is morally inadequate. Orthodox priests uphold the teaching of the Catholic Church and procreation; pastoral priests appeal to individual conscience and love."
335;1980;"One of the more controversial and yet little examined aspects of the current ""new"" religions, such as the Unification Church and the Hare Krishnas, is their common strategy of public fundraising, i.e., depending on the very societies which they condemn for voluntary contributions. Using a resource mobilization approach from social movements theory, we examine the organizational infrastructure of such a fund-raising strategy (in terms of organizational requisites, subcultural ideology, and situational constraints) as it comes to be used by world-transforming movements. The analysis describes the dynamics of a strategy that elevates the ritual of public solicitation to sacramental significance and indicates what its potential returns for certain social movements might be."
336;1980;"Recent research has noted a negative relationship between ideal family size (IFS) and proabortion attitudes (AA) which is independent of religious affiliation. The present investigation extends the investigation of this relationship in several ways. First, we find considerable variation in abortion attitudes among the Protestant denominations; this finding warrants a denomination-specific analysis. Second, controlling for religious affiliation within Protestantism, we find numerous examples of the spuriousness of the IFS-AA relationship. Third, the 1973 US Supreme Court decision regarding abortion is found to have limited impact on the number of significant associations between IFS and AA. At the same time, for most denominations, IFS remains a significant predictor of AA. Fourth, we assess the importance of IFS relative to seven other independent variables in a multiple regression analysis and find that IFS is a significant predictor of an index of overall abortion attitudes. While Renzi's hypothesis is therefore successfully extended in each stage of this analysis, numerous exceptions appear, particularly for denominations with strong proabortion sentiments. Finally, we note that IFS may have a limited history as a predictor variable if a national consensus emerges around the two child family."
337;1980;Religious educational methodology generally takes an active approach, with more student involvement. This study investigates the relative effectiveness of more active, personally involving activities and more passive, less personally involving methods. We find no differences in the performance of youth on a content examination or a maturity inventory after exposure to these contrasting educational methods.
338;1980;Religious leaders of Moroccan Jewish communities in the Atlas Mountains, stemming from generations of certain notable families, commanded personal authority. To the more illustrious were attributed charismatic traits. After moving to Israel, these rabbis and their flocks confronted a bureaucratic organization of religious services in which rabbis were appointed according to universal criteria and received a regular wage. A follow-up study of a transplanted Atlas Mountain community traces the decline of traditional religious leadership and the process of community accommodation to a bureaucratically appointed rabbi.
339;1980;"Research on tongue-speaking is surveyed, and its methodological assumptions are suggested. These assumptions are threefold, concerning how psychologists, sociologists, and anthropologists believe glossolalia functions: Some believe it to be aberrant behaviour; others think of it as extraordinary behaviour; and still others regard it as anomalous behaviour. Examples of these positions are given, their shortcomings are presented, and a fourth methodological paradigm is offered as a corrective: Glossolalia is seen as ritual behaviour which aims, first, to amalgamate the sounds of crying and laughing, which are symbols of hurt and joy in life, and, second, it thereby points to conditions of existence, that is, to death and birth in life. Thus, tongue-speaking is a ritual process where in a ""scanning"" of one's phenomenal world takes place, useful in facilitating the biological survival of the individual."
340;1980;The most powerful way to move beyond the intellectual bankruptcy contributed to the social scientific study of religion by cultural relativism is to defend a version of innate ideas embedded in a biogenetic account of how religion and culture evolved in tandem with physical changes in the hominid genotype going back at least to australopithecine adjustments during the late Pleistocene. Modern man's phylogenetic inheritance provides one key to explaining the persistence of religious behaviors in circumstances radically different from those to which they were originally a response. The other indispensible key for understanding our perduring religious predisposition concerns the unique ontogenetic lot of Homo sapiens. Welding these two angles of vision together allows us to take cultural diversity with full seriousness without having to mince on the importance of panculturally applicable scientific principles.
341;1980;"The spread of Hasidism in the Jewish communities of eastern Europe in the last decades of the eighteenth and first decades of the nineteenth century is related to the routinization of charisma in the form of the dynasties of the ""zaddikim,"" the leaders of the movement. The coexistence of two principles of charismatic succession, together with multiple succession, resulted in features which contributed to the success of the movement: the continual formation of many new branches, a decentralized and segmental structure, and diversity of religious values and practices."
342;1980;This article describes the labor markets and salary determination processes for Protestant clergy. First, the labor markets are described as they appear to the individual church as well as to the ministers. Next, twenty-eight personal and structural factors are used in the Automatic Interaction Detector (AID) algorithm to identify the most important influences in the salary determination process. Finally, salary is predicted using the Multiple Classification Analysis (MCA) to determine the relative importance of each variable to the explanation of the variation in salary.
343;1980;This case study examines the relationship between the testimony and the belief system of a holiness-pentecostal sect. The step-by-step structure of their traditional fundamentalist theology, a lack of formal passage rites promoting moves between steps, and a belief in spiritual growth through a series of private transformation experiences, create the need for some identity work in this sectarian community. Testimony is shown to address this need in its capacity to locate individuals ritually in the social matrix of the group, while concomitantly affirming their desire to change social positions through a more intimate encounter with the spirit.
344;1980;"This paper analyzes current patterns of intergenerational denominational mobility and trends in affiliation (or no affiliation), by merging 5 years of national survey data and using log linear modeling techniques. Results indicate that denominational mobility is influenced by a set of factors--such as the Catholic-Protestant-Jewish cleavage and geographic region, whose influence has remained constant in recent times. The only major trend indicated is toward an increasing choice of no religious affiliation; yet even here there has been a constant tendency for those raised with no affiliation to adopt one."
345;1980;This paper outlines some of the current knowledge about Jewish identification and some of the substantive and methodological issues that still need to be resolved. It focuses upon studies which exemplify new research trends, and discusses the implications of these trends for the field. Consistencies and inconsistencies in the definition and measurement of Jewish identification are described, and the work needed to make the measurement of the concept of Jewish identification more efficient is noted. The opportunities and challenges for Jews to be involved with Jewish life vary with the social environment. The following environmental influences are discussed: generation, community, socioeconomic status, and the events of Jewish history (anti-Semitism). Particular socialization experiences, which reinforce or counter general environmental influences, such as the influence of parents, siblings, spouse, peers, youth groups, summer camps, and trips to Israel are also discussed.
346;1980;This paper presents the basic axioms and some initial definitions from which we are constructing a general theory of religion. Here we carry the deductive process only to the point where three testable and non-trivial propositions about religious commitment are obtained. These propositions explain and clarify the available empirical literature. In subsequent papers we shall deduce and test other results from this theoretical system.
347;1980;This paper takes issue with psychologized attempts to explain the tragedy of Jonestown and People's Temple, and offers a corrective to the usual treatments that lump People's Temple with a number of other religious groups, especially the so-called new religions. People's Temple is compared with new religions on eight points: (1) social location and time of inception, (2) characteristics of members and potential members, (3) organizational structure and operation, (4) social control techniques and outside contact, (5) resocialization techniques, (6) theology or ideology, (7) general orientation, and (8) ritual behaviors. Policy implications of failure to discern such differences are also discussed.
348;1980;This paper uses Harrison's rational-pragmatic authority as a model to organize results of participant observation of two Southern Baptist Churches. The findings contradict notions that pastors in congregationally-organized churches are unable to control church policy and a number of mechanisms contributing to pastoral power are delineated. Finally, the resistance of these pastors to formal organization is explored and related to the church-sect typology.
349;1980;Though many discussions have posited a relationship between religion and well-being among the bereaved, this relationship has not been examined fully or systematically. As a guide to such inquiries, many of the concepts and research findings generated in other studies of religion may be applied to the problem of bereavement. This paper presents a conceptual framework for examining the relationships between religious commitment and adjustment to bereavement. Drawing on literature that has conceptualized religion alternatively as a source of meaning and as a source of belonging, it develops a number of hypotheses about the manner in which specific religious beliefs, moral commitments, experiences, and practices may influence levels of well-being among the bereaved. Some attention is also given to the role of funerary rites in the adjustment process.
350;1980;"Three dimensions underlying an implicit understanding of religious concepts are described. Instead of answering a set of attitude and belief items, a sample of subjects was asked to generate their own lists of ""religious ideas or concepts."" A second sample of subjects then rated the 33 most frequently mentioned concepts on each of 16 bipolar scales. Those judgements were analyzed by Carroll and Chang's (1970) INDSCAL program. A three-dimensional solution emerged that contrasted institutional against individual orientations, evaluations that are positive or negative, and what is tangible in religion against what is intangible. These results are discussed in relation to the dimensions of religion that have been previously identified."
351;1980;"Yinger (1977) has argued that all religions have a common ""substructure"" consisting of three essential components: the persistent experience of suffering, injustice, and meaninglessness. Yinger's argument rests substantially on evidence from answers to an open-ended question which asks respondents to designate what they feel to be the most fundamental or important issue for the human race. A partial test of Yinger's hypothesis on a sample of university students shows that ""love"" is the largest single response -- even when the themes of suffering, injustice, and meaninglessness are combined into one category. A separate questionnaire on ""love"" is then developed involving a modification of Yinger's open-ended question. Results show that the themes of suffering, injustice, and meaninglessness disappear almost entirely while the perceived importance of ""love"" is partially supported. However, the hypothesis of love as part of a ""substructure"" of religion is not supported by the data. Some problems encountered in the empirical investigation of a structural theory of religion are discussed."
352;1981;A survey of Chicago Protestant ministers done in 1928 was replicated in 1978. A total of 54 questions about religious beliefs were asked in six denominations. The overall change was a shift of about 7 percentage points in the liberal direction. Beliefs on some theological topics changed, while others did not change. The topics changing most were the nature and authority of the Bible, the place of the church in Christian life, the afterlife, and the meaning of pain and suffering. Of the six denominations, the Lutherans changed most since 1928, when they were clearly the most conservative. The trends portray not a general secularization but a series of selective changes reflecting the forces of assimilation and accommodation.
353;1981;Advanced meditators in the Zen tradition occasionally experience traumatic physical seizures accompanied by powerful, disruptive emotions, a development consistently taken by meditation masters as signs of progress toward enlightenment. Using data from LSD research, this paper suggests that these seizures are emerging birth-trauma memories. Interpreting these perinatal memories as memories of fetal impingement, it then turns to object-relations theory to study the effect of impingement and impingement-generated fear on ego-development in order to understand why embodied impingement memories should manifest in the ego-dissolving context of meditation. It argues that a coherent explanation for the manifestation of these symptoms can be had by combining insights from these two fields with the understanding of meditation and consciousness emerging in transpersonal psychology.
354;1981;"American civil religion has been the subject of recent scholarly interest among American sociologists of religion, leading to a sociological debate. This paper examines the sociological literature concerning American civil religion in an attempt to order the literature into a coherent, comprehensive, and logical set of definitions and assumptions open to empirical investigation. Four basic propositions adapted from the work of John A. Coleman are framed to address the crucial questions most often asked by contemporary sociologists of American civil religion: (a) American civil religion is the religious symbol system which relates the citizen's role and American society's place in space, time, and history to the conditions of ultimate existence and meaning; (b) American civil religion is structurally differentiated from both the political community and the religious community; (c) American civil religion performs specialized religious functions performed neither by church nor state; and (d) the differentiation of American civil religion follows the general direction of cultural evolution. Review of the American civil religion literature reveals sufficient logical and empirical support for these propositions to recommend that they be used to guide further scientific inquiry."
355;1981;"As Geertz (1973) and Turner (1969) suggest, ritual not only reflects the social order but can serve innovative and transformative ends as well. In a field study of a Reform synagogue, two liturgical rituals were identified which together reveal or express culture-wide tensions. One ritual reflects the dominance of modern values, in conformity with the institution's commitment to modernity; the other is an expression of ""counter-modern"" efforts. In rejecting some of the main features of the first ritual, the second ritual reflects changing values as it contests the dominant institutional order and projects alternative religious possibilities for its participants. Thus ritual in this setting emerges as both social mirror and agent of socio-cultural change."
356;1981;"Bainbridge and Stark's essay on ""The Consciousness Reformation"" illustrates conceptual and theoretical ambiguities characteristic of research in the scientific study of religion more generally. This paper traces these ambiguities to the presence of two competing, but poorly differentiated, epistemological traditions. An examination of the assumptions implicit within each of these traditions provides a basis for clarifying the distinction between religious symbolism and religious belief, the concept of meaning, the difference between consistency as an attribute of belief and coherence as an attribute of reality, and the role of interpersonal bonds in maintaining the plausibility of religious symbolism. An emerging third perspective that appears to circumvent some of the limitations of the two major epistemological traditions is also discussed."
357;1981;Conventional theories of Pentecostalism, which stress its compensatory functions, have little to say about its most distinctive feature -- Spirit possession. A replication theory of religious ritual, emphasizing the expressive role of religious symbols, is able to interpret this phenomenon better. Observations of ritual show that themes of power and control are most prominent: these resonate with Pentecostals' social situation, particularly their attitude toward work.
358;1981;Data from sample surveys of Utah and the Mountain States are used in conjunction with the State of Utah's annual statistical report on characteristics of divorcing couples to assess differentials in the probabilities of divorce by type of interfaith marriage. Results show same-faith marriages to be much more stable than interfaith marriages. Among interfaith marriages, the particular combination makes a striking difference in the probabilities of divorce. The divorce rate for certain interfaith combinations is as much as nine times higher than that for other combinations. In Utah, marriages in which neither partner has a religious preference are markedly unstable, but so are unions between Catholics and Mormons. The lowest divorce rates appear for Catholic and Mormon same-faith marriages, the highest for interfaith marriages involving Mormons, and, in Utah at least, marriages in which neither partner has a religious preference. The probabilities that an interfaith marriage will end in divorce depend not only upon the specific faiths involved, but also upon which spouse belongs to which faith.
359;1981;Differences in gender socialization have male youths receiving more power assertion, while female youths are given more nurture. Self-reliance and increasing autonomy are emphasized for the former, while obedience is the pattern for the latter. Applied to religious transmission, with parental discord as one context, and coupled with Kelman's processes of social influence, this suggests that by junior high school, boys, especially those perceiving their parents as high in discord, should show a decline in religiousness, compared to boys in grades 4-6 (the data are cross-sectional and are from 2724 youths in intact families in Minnesota). For this group the decline should occur only for those receiving corporal punishment. T-tests of means supported this hypothesis. An examination of the means suggests that boys in this same group at grades 4-6 score higher in religiousness than would be expected based on their perceptions of their parents' religious levels. Parental discord does not have as clear an effect upon girls. In general girls in grades 7-8 are less likely to see their parents as religious than are girls in grades 4-6. There is a general decline in religiousness by grade for girls. It is concluded that family relations are important in the transmission of religiosity across generations.
360;1981;From a pool of approximately 400 persons, 20 extreme intrinsic and 20 extreme extrinsic persons took part in a sensory isolation experiment in which varieties of reported imagery were the dependent variables. Participants spent one hour in a sensory isolation tank under either a cartoon imagery set or a religious imagery set condition. Three non-relevant set variables (light, geometric forms, meaningful figures) were also assessed as dependent variables. As predicted, multivariate analysis of variance indicated a significant effect for both set and religious type. Univariate analyses for religious imagery showed effects for both set and religious type, while for cartoon imagery, only set was significant. In a second study to assess possible demand characteristics in the isolation experiment, 65 intrinsic persons and 54 extrinsic persons associated to standard Rorschach cards under either cartoon, religious or no set conditions. Subjects' responses were classified as religious, cartoon, or neutral. Results of nonparametric statistical tests indicated that, as predicted, within all the set conditions, there was no statistical difference between the number of responses given by the religious types across any of the response categories.
361;1981;Hysteria is a condition often observed and reported upon by anthropologists and other social scientists in Papua New Guinea. This paper focuses on a form of hysteria that has gone largely unreported: hysterical behavior as it is manifested during revival movements. Emphasis is placed upon those factors and set of conditions that appear to have induced or contributed towards examples of individual and mass hysteria: missionary zeal, the use of hypersuggestability, and the operation of stress. Analysis of hysteria and accompanying religious phenomena are derived from personal interviews and observation, examination of psychiatric patients, and a comprehensive review of government reports and mission literature.
362;1981;In contrast to previous research that stressed structural and contextual effects on decision making in religious organizations, this research examines the decision making process itself as a test of the normative character of religious groups. Two-hundred and eighty-nine decisions in three Baptist churches were examined and a strong inverse relationship was found between the socio-economic status of the decision maker and the frequency of appeals to normative basis of authority. A tentative theory of role overlap is postulated to account for the results, in addition to the existence of apparent group specific differences in norms of verbalization.
363;1981;It would seem that a person's theological beliefs should relate to his or her views about the world in general. And yet previous research on the Philosophies of Human Nature (PHN) scale reveals a remarkable dearth of consistent relationships with religious variables. An assumption of theological homogeneity in theologically heterogeneous populations may have obscured consistent associations in past studies. Hence in the present study it was predicted that beliefs, specifically Calvinistic beliefs, would correlate positively with (a) cynicism, and negatively with (b) an internal locus of control, and (c) beliefs that people are conventionally good. A Calvinistic versus Arminian theological belief scale was developed, and the scores of 86 white, single males aged 21-30 attending a large evangelical seminary in New England were compared with the PHN. The hypotheses were confirmed. Implications and recommendations for future research are offered in conclusion.
364;1981;Many scholars in the Social Sciences have attempted to integrate the phenomenon of the European witch hunts of the 14th-17th centuries in broader, more eclectic interpretive schemes dealing with the period. This paper critically examines the problematics involved in such attempts. By pointing to three relevant issues which must first be resolved, one can better understand the witch craze itself, thus possessing a more valid and reliable basis for integrating it into all types of broader interpretative schemes. These issues include the timing of the hunts, their content, and their target.
365;1981;"My purpose here is to identify selected turning points of western thought as they interacted with critical turning points in social organization, to shape the ""deep trajectory"" of social presupposition necessary for the rise of modern, Western principles of human rights. The deeply religious aspects of both thought and societal structure are involved at each juncture. In the process of exhuming these presuppositions from the Western traditions, several questions arise for the scientific study of religion, and for the relationship of scholarship to the ethical basis of modern civilization."
366;1981;"Social scientists often assume that individuals and societies orient themselves with respect to overarching symbolic frames of reference, sometimes called ""meaning systems."" But until the recent publication of Robert Wuthnow's analysis of San Francisco area survey data, evidence in favor of this key theoretical proposition has been lacking. This paper inspects both a new network survey of 1439 respondents and the original data in search of the four competing meaning systems reported by Wuthnow. We find strong evidence demonstrating that traditional religion remains an influential meaning system, producing conventional attitudes and preventing experimentation with radical lifestyles and occult practices. But the three alleged secular meaning systems failed to emerge, even in the original data. These findings undercut the assumption that most persons possess meaning systems, and they support our view that a meaning system is easiest to sustain if it is based on supernatural beliefs and promulgated by formal church organizations and religious social movements."
367;1981;"The recent renaissance of research on religious conversion, and the varying stresses emerging in that work, prompt an effort to isolate ""conversion motifs."" Based on five major and underlying variations, six motifs are identified: intellectual, mystical, experimental, affectional, revivalist and coercive. Social psychological and social organizational implications of these patterns are discussed."
368;1981;The use of charisma as a social scientific concept is criticized for being theoretically ambiguous and methodologically imprecise. Measurement by the semantic differential technique, where bi-polar adjectives of charisma are evaluated by 130 judges and subsequently sugjected to varimax factor analysis, resulted in a proposed ten-item index. Not only did the index portray high reliability coefficients, but it also appears equally valid as it differentiates well between Pierre Trudeau as highly charismatic and Joe Clark as non-charismatic.
369;1981;This paper explores a theoretical gap in the study of public communication in literate, historical societies. A cursory examination of the history of the various Islamic lands reveals the special position of the mosque as the center of the Moslem community and the dominant role of the Islamic pulpit in the development of socio-political issues. A casual comparison of the modern mass media with the Islamic pulpit shows some similarities between them which conflict with Lerner's model. The paper concludes that systematic examination of the media of public communication from a cross-cultural-historical perspective would probably reveal significant continuities between the modes of public communication in pre-industrial and industrial societies.
370;1981;This paper measures the overall impact of adaptive constraints forced on the local church by its demographic environment, and determines the relative strengths of various contextual indicators. Four SMSAs were selected for study. In all of the cities, membership data were collected for each church among the five largest, predominantly white, Protestant denominations. Churches were also located within their census tracts to obtain indicators of the surrounding demographic setting. The results of this study reveal that the demographic environment, especially population change, has a large impact on church membership change. Also, this impact differs greatly from city to city according to the range of demographic variation found in each location.
371;1981;This paper presents an analysis of the ambiguity in role definition of pastors of Southern Baptist churches. Attention is focused on the socialization process whereby clergy develop an authoritarian self-image, as well as on the interplay between religious understanding and democratic organization. The problem of ambiguous role definition becomes operative in situations where the congregation is unwilling to follow pastoral initiative, and requires pastors to adopt various methods of managing their ambiguous role. Three types of response -- role segregation, abdication, and manipulation -- are described, illustrated, and analyzed according to their effects on the pastor and the congregation. Several implications of the analysis are discussed.
372;1981;"This paper reports initial descriptive findings based on quantitative coding of basic features of 417 American-born sects still in existence. Sects are less numerous than are cults but are, on the average, older and larger. Nonetheless, most sects are small and very few are growing rapidly at present. Indeed, about a third have not grown since their initial formation. A major impediment to sect growth appears to be the fact that most begin in a state of very high tension with their environment -- so high as to cut them off from potential recruits. Moreover, once founded, very few sects subsequently reduce their initial tension level (only 4% have markedly lowered their tension; 10% have reduced it modestly). However, those that have lowered their tension are overwhelmingly those that have achieved significant growth. When sect ""families"" are examined, the Pentecostals are the most numerous group, followed by the Holiness, Baptist, and Adventist families. Tennessee has the most sects per million population. However, aside from Tennessee, the rest of the South is not unusually prolific in sects. While cults are highly concentrated on the West Coast, the Pacific region has a relatively low sect rate. It is in New England that sects are least numerous, and we suggest historic reasons why this is so. Finally, the data show that, with population taken into account, the United States does not have an unusually large number of sects. Even when only Christian sects are counted, Africa has a sect rate more than six times as high as the U. S."
373;1981;This paper reports our second effort to test the thesis that secularization is a self-limiting process that prompts the formation of new religions. Our initial study was based on contemporary data. Here we turn the clock back 50 years to the Roaring Twenties. Using excellent data from the sadly neglected and forgotten U.S. Census enumerations of religious membership, we demonstrate that cults thrive where conventional churches are weak. Drawing on our theory of religion we try to explain why this occurs.
374;1981;"Three factorially derived aspects of religiousness -- intrinsic, orthodoxy, practice -- are examined with indices of sex-role identity and interpersonal style. The data were analyzed separately for boys (N = 297) and girls (N = 344) from several Catholic parochial schools. The results indicate that religiousness is related to sex-role definition in boys, but not in girls; conversely, interpersonal style is more predictive of religiousness in girls."
375;1981;"When traditional communal bonds break down, new religious forms arise to meet the needs of people faced with anomie. These new forms, it seems, often emphasize ""inner-directedness;"" no longer able to rely on traditional behavior patterns, victims of social dislocation develop inner determinants of action. In the West, such inner determinants have often been provided by evangelical Christianity. Revival preachers have sought to stem the tide of social chaos by providing people with an inner religious ""gyroscope"" (i.e., a Biblically guided conscience) thus making the masterless their own masters. Guided by the inner gyroscope of the Holy Spirit, evangelicals have been enabled to steer through the anomie of rapid social transformation. But there is an irony to this pattern wherein evangelicalism emerges in response to social change. It is simply this: in at least three historical instances, an inwardly directed evangelical Christianity born of social dislocation has itself become, in a few short steps, an agency for vastly accelerating the pace of social change. When further infused with millennial expectations, it has even become an agency of revolution."
376;1981;"Working from the theoretical model and historical analysis provided in ""Into Denominationalism: The Anglican Metamorphosis,"" this essay addresses the socio-cultural significance of denominationalism in America, the apparent decline of denominational religiosity in contemporary society, and the rise of ""nondenominational"" churches. T. H. Breen's concept of ""persistent localism"" is introduced to suggest a common Anglo-American cultural heritage for the social function of denominations. With the shift from a rural home-farm productive-consumptive society to an urban bureau-technical one, the traditional denominations, as religious organizations in conformity with their socio-cultural environment, developed into large supralocal non-profit corporations. In so doing, they failed to recognize the importance of localism in maintaining voluntary organizations. As our system is currently engaged in a centralization-decentralization push-pull process, the non-coercive nature of religious pluralism prohibits the traditional denominations from exercising controls of any significance to retain or increase their membership. The new nondenominational churches, then, are emerging as the functional and typological equivalents of the traditional denominations."
377;1981;Wuthnow has argued that a shift in religious trends occurred when those under age 35 differentiated themselves symbolically from their elders. He used belief in afterlife, among other data, as a dependent variable. I report data concerning this central tenet from 1944, 1960, and 1973-75-76-78, and I show a long-range decline in belief for older Americans and a blip in belief (an increase in 1960 over 1944) for young Americans and then a decline for them. A positive relationship between age and belief existed in 1944 but not in 1960 or the mid-1970s. The concept of the formation of a generational gap in religiousness subsequent to the religious revival of the 1950s cannot be supported by data on belief in afterlife. Future studies should chart whether this belief continues to erode and should explore the implications of the apparent disappearance of this traditional appeal for older Americans to be religious.
378;1982;Anxiety has correlated both positively and negatively with religion in past research. We suggest this is because undifferentiated measures of both religion and anxiety have been used. When intrinsic and extrinsic scales were correlated with Cattell's factors of trait anxiety, intrinsics were less anxious than non-intrinsics, and extrinsics were more anxious than non-extrinsics on some -- but not all -- components of trait anxiety. Studies using a general measure of religiousness will find a positive correlation with anxiety if the sample contains more extrinsics than intrinsics, and a negative one if the sample contains more intrinsics than extrinsics, or no relationship if an inappropriate component of anxiety is measured.
379;1982;Contemporary theorizing on sect-like religious bodies has focused on the size of entire religious organizations as an important variable in the study of these groups, particularly their transformation into denominations. In contrast, Weber and Troeltsch identified small size of congregation rather than of denomination as the sine qua non of sect-like organizational structure. This paper tests the hypothesis that small congregation size is associated with sect-like congregational attributes and therefore is likely to impede transition from sect-like to church-like (or denominational) religious organizations. It is also hypothesized that the size of the communities in which congregations are located will differentially affect congregational organizational structure, with smaller communities enhancing tendencies toward sect-like characteristics. These hypotheses are tested on a representative sample of Church of the Nazarene congregations. Four dependent variables measure sect-like congregational structural attributes: rigorous membership criteria, the conversion rate, the reversion rate, and the proportion of the annual congregational budget contributed to the denomination. The findings furnish strong support for the hypothesis that congregational size is correlated with these structural attributes, while weaker support is furnished for the hypothesis that community size is similarly related.
380;1982;Despite extensive theoretical attention to the importance of participation in such organizations as local churches, the effects of participation are seldom separated from those of control. We distinguish participation from control, defining the former as involvement in an organization's processes and the latter as actual influence over decisions. Then we examine relationships between participation in the everyday processes of local churches and members' satisfaction, the relative growth of the churches, and the churches' involvement in social action. Our analysis indicates that participation is compatible with satisfaction and high rates of growth, and the effects of participation hold under a variety of conditions. However, participation appears to be less important than aspects of control for understanding satisfaction, growth in membership, and social action policies in these organizations. The findings suggest that leaders should not rely on participation alone to strengthen local churches. Attention must be given to actual influence over decisions.
381;1982;"Differences in family role definitions and enactment among Utah Catholics, Protestants, Mormons, and persons claiming no religious preference are assessed in an analysis of mail survey data (N = 2005) obtained in 1974 from a random sample of Utahans. Mormons are shown to differ from non-Mormons more in attitudes about the family than in family behavior. They are less tolerant than are non-Mormons of nontraditional role definitions, and they exhibit more ""family centeredness"" in their attitudes, but do not differ from Catholics or Protestants in preferences about the division of family labor. Apparent differences in role enactment tend to be differences between persons having a religious preference and those without, rather than inter-denominational differences."
382;1982;For at least the past ninety years, some social critics have charged that religion imprisons women in traditional sex roles and denies them access to high-status occupations. This article uses census data from the United States in 1930 and 1970, and from Canada in 1961, to explore this question, focusing especially on the professions of banker, lawyer, physician, and industrial manager. The critique of religion was not supported by American data, while the Canadian data did give strong support. After considering subsidiary hypotheses, we concluded that the influence of religion on occupational sex roles varies greatly, dependent upon the secular forces channeled through religion and on the form and direction which religious organization takes.
383;1982;"It has long been argued that important relationships exist in American society between religious institutions, the values they teach, and family life. This essay examines the ways in which contemporary social scientists depict these relationships. The data consist of a content analysis of writings in sociology of the family texts, sociology of religion texts, and journals in the latter field. Studies of the ""social control"" functions of religion far outnumber those focusing on more qualitative ""social support"" aspects. Several interpretations and consequences of these trends are discussed."
384;1982;"Little research has dealt with economic policies and practices of the new religions, and treatments that do exist focus mainly on street solititation as the major fund-raising devise. This study examines alternative fund-raising methods for a number of new religions and ""self-help"" groups, revealing numerous ways in which new religions support themselves financially. Also, groups such as the Unification Church and Children of God, which are best known for their aggressive street solicitation have engaged in a number of different money-raising techniques. The research reveals that experimentation is the major thrust of fund-raising efforts in the new religions, as they try many different methods, singularly and in combination, in efforts to support themselves. The paper closes with a discussion of ideas from the literature on communal studies that could be examined in studies of economic policies of new religions."
385;1982;"Modern culture, for a variety of structural reasons, is distinguished by a subjectivism -- an orientation marked not so much by vanity as it is by an incessant preoccupation with the hitherto ""undiscovered"" complexities of the self. Evangelicalism accommodates to this cultural situation by expanding the parameters of its theodicy. No longer does the conservative Protestant theodicy deal exclusively with the problems of suffering, grief, and death. Included within the new theodicy are the attempts to cope with the endless musings of modern intra-subjectivity: ""psychological balance,"" ""emotional maturity,"" ""self-actualization"" and so on. By a thematic content analysis of Evangelical mass market and trade monographs (N = 1609), and substantive content analysis of a sub-sample of the same, the intricacies of this phenomenon are explored. The consequences of this adaptation for American Evangelicalism are also examined."
386;1982;Poe divination, akin to multiple coin-flipping in form, is the commonest sort of everyday divination used in Taiwan. This paper explores the statistical properties of poe as they are used by Hokkien-speakers in Taiwan, and suggests that these qualities are known and deliberately manipulated by Taiwanese when they use poe, even though they simultaneously believe the fall of the poe to be governed by divine will.
387;1982;"Religious ""cults"" have been the subject of many investigations by social scientists. There is, however, still a need for research which focuses on the dynamic relationship between cults and their community environments. This paper focuses on three different cults (or marginal religious movements) and their community context, a midwestern metropolitan area. Of particular interest here are (1) the similar problems of cults in relation to their community context, and (2) the ways that their particular goals influence their differing ""community interfaces."" This concept is developed and used to extend the social movement organization literature to understand better the dynamic aspects of the movement-environment relationship. Some hypotheses are offered about the relationships between types of community interfaces and directions of organizational change."
388;1982;"Shifts in denominational preference and its correlates among residents of Middletown are assessed using data from sample surveys by the Middletown III project supplemented by archival data and comparisons with the descriptions of the city in the Lynds ""Middletown."" Contemporary Middletown is predominantly Protestant. Demographically the gap between the city's ""Southern"" and ""Northern"" Protestants is the major denominational cleavage. There is a trend toward denominational convergence: on many characteristics the city's Catholics are indistinguishable from its Protestants. There is no evidence of a decline in participation in organized religion. An apparent stability in the denominational distribution of the population masks substantial intergenerational switching."
389;1982;"The author uses a modified version of Erikson's six-stage (numinous, judicial, dramatic, formal, ideal and nomatic) ontogeny of ritualization to discuss the problems of individual freedom and community control. A case study of Johann Driedger is used to highlight the struggle for individual freedom within a rural conservative Old Colony Mennonite community. The leaders of this ethno-religious community sought to control their members in numinous rural villages by judicious means. Some members, like Driedger, tested the boundaries of the Gemeinshaft, by introducing new initiatives and industry. The church, however, judiciously discouraged such innovations by excommunication and the ban. The ritual process got stuck at the judicious stage two. Driedger experimented with new initiative (stage 3) and industry (stage 4), but in the end was forced to retreat. He died before his vision of a new ideology (stage 5) took hold; he did not experience the certification of a new nomatic religious community (stage 6)."
390;1982;The conceptualization, development and cross-validation of a 24-item Christian Orthodoxy Scale is described. Eight different studies are involved, which include samples of Canadian high school students, university students, and the parents of university students, as well as a sample of Australian university students. Evidence is presented that the scale is unidimensional, reliable and valid. Factor analyses have consistently revealed a single factor which accounts for a large portion of the total test variance (ranging from 58% to 74%). Mean inter-item correlations have remained high across samples (typically between .60 and .70), Cronbach's alpha was .98, and the 24 items comprising the scale loaded (usually considerably) higher than .61 on the single factor in the various studies. It is concluded that the scale constitutes a useful general purpose measure of one dimension of Christian religiousness -- Christian orthodoxy.
391;1982;"The Hutterites of North America have been remarkably successful in maintaining their austere communal existence and separation from ""the world."" The permanent loss of members through defection has been minimal, and largely restricted to unmarried young men in search of adventure. Recently, however, a new form of defection has emerged which involves a conscious repudiation of central Hutterite religious tenets. Increasingly, individuals are abandoning their colonies as a direct result of their conversion to evangelical Protestantism. We attempt to account for this phenomenon in terms of the attraction that personalized, individualistic Protestantism holds for the collectivistic Hutterites, and how conversion can ease the burdens of defection. Finally, we show how the Hutterites' own attempts to win converts ultimately renders them vulnerable to the proselytization of others."
392;1982;"The ideal and actual configurations of control over the National Staff of the Reformed Church in America was measured using a modified version of Tannenbaum's control graph. Modifications include an ""open system model"" which assumes that, in voluntary associations, the governing board and association members must be perceived as active environments relative to the bureaucratically structured National Staff. To varying degrees, depending upon respondents' social location relative to the National Staff, members of these social units (a) desire and (b) feel that they do exercise different amounts of control over the National Staff. It was found that, in contrast to traditional Protestant rejection of ecclesiastical exercise of power, bureaucratic demands have led to perceptions of highly centralized patterns of control resting in the National Staff."
393;1982;The mainline Protestant churches are in the throes of a second great depression, a depression far worse than the one they experienced 50 years ago. Reinhold Niebuhr's criticism of liberalism and his program for theological and political renewal helped the churches recover from the first depression. But Niebuhr's program proved unworkable in the long run and it has left a legacy of pessimism and guilt that impede recovery from the current depression. The churches now need to renew those elements of their liberal heritage that encourage optimism and a more positive approach to the cure of souls.
394;1982;The relationship between religion and social integration has inspired sociological inquiry since the discipline originated. To address the issue empirically, this paper considers the effects of religious affiliation on two attitudinal measures of social integration. Derived from a survey of 548 non-institutionalized adult residents of Wisconsin, the analyses disclose that respondents without traditional Christian religious affiliations were less likely than their counterparts to feel attached to their residential localities. The introduction of controls for status and social participation variables using the analysis of covariance indicates more fully the nature of the relationships being examined. The findings partially support functionalist theories of religion. Avenues for future research are noted in conclusion.
395;1982;This article analyzes participation rates in new religious and para-religious movements, as indicated by surveys administered in Montreal in 1975 and 1980. When these movements are broadly defined to include various charismatic and semi-religious therapy and martial arts groups, then the survey data indicate both a comparative high rate of participation but also a remarkably high rate for dropping out of these movements. The average participant associates for a while with these movements, often as a peripheral adherent, and then drops out. The article analyzes the kinds of groups persons are most likely to have participated in, and some of the characteristic features of participants.
396;1982;This article demonstrates the value for the sociology of religion of data in the original manuscript schedules of the United States census. In so doing it presents previously unknown rich information on the changing demographic structure of the Shaker communities, significant for evaluating theories of the fates of utopian experiments. To begin with, we report the first good population statistics for twenty-two Shaker colonies at four points in time: 1840, 1860, 1880, and 1900. Data on ethnic origins and occupations give a picture of the Shakers and their economic activities. The main analysis focuses on the changing age structure and sex ratio, providing new insights into patterns of recruitment, defection, and the gradual decline of this utopian sect. In conclusion, we propose a wide range of future research projects which can be done in microfilm archives of the original census documents.
397;1982;"This paper examines the role of the Christian Right in the 1980 presidential election. Throughout the campaign the media reported that this movement was a major political development, and its members would be an important source of votes for Ronald Reagan. However, interviews with residents of ""Middletown,"" who voted for the major presidential candidates in almost the same proportions as was the case nationwide, revealed that disproportionate support for Reagan did not come from the Christian Right but from conservatives of high education (traditional Republicans) and from people who considered controlling inflation to be the most important issue in the election. A discussion of why religion, and religious fundamentalism in particular, does not play a significant role in American politics is then presented."
398;1982;This paper provides a summary of Hjalmar Sundén's role-taking theory, and then applies the theory to two crises in Newman's life, both involving his relationships with Oxford mentors.
399;1982;"This study explores the structure and measurement of non-convention religious beliefs. Items were written so as to represent systematically major classifications of the domain, and compiled with Law's (1974) Inventory of Personal Beliefs, which covered Christian Beliefs together with Ways to Live (derived from Morris, 1956). One hundred and eighty subjects, representing selected criterion groups, completed the resulting inventory; factor analyses of the responses to each of the three item sets produced five Non-Conventional Beliefs factors, three Christian Beliefs factors; and five Ways to Live factors. In view of the necessity of understanding the structure of religious beliefs and measuring the major variables as an important preliminary step in the psychology of religion, we submit that the Non-Conventional Beliefs items form a worthwhile addition to the Inventory of Personal Beliefs, making it a useful tool for further research in this area."
400;1982;This study, based on interviews, analyzes the changes that have occurred in the evolution of the Black Muslim movement to Sunni orthodoxy, the American Muslim Mission led by Mujeddid Wallace Deen Muhammad. It also examines the rise and growth of a countermovement, the resurrected Nation of Islam, led by Minister Louis Farrakhan. A Weberian framework is employed to understand the schism in the movement in relation to socio-economic changes that have occurred during the past 50 years. The argument is that the Black Muslim work ethic and morality have produced the unintended consequence of changing a predominantly lower-class movement into a middle-class one. This change in class status produced favorable conditions for changes in ideology. A case is made for a growing class split between Wallace's predominantly middle-class American Muslim movment and Farrakhan's lower-class Nation of Islam.
401;1982;"Three studies investigated the possibility of experimenter effects influencing the results of questionnaire and interview studies of religious attitudes. The first involved two experimenters playing the role of a priest and layman respectively, who administered a questionnaire on religious attitudes to first-year sociology students (primarily Roman Catholics). A second study involved altering information on a covering sheet of a questionnaire such that each (approximate) quarter of the sample of summer university students believed that the research was directed/sponsored by: a priest/Roman Catholic group; a minister/Protestant group; a professor/university group; or an untitled male/undergraduate student group. In the third study 52 students from Protestant backgrounds were interviewed by either a Protestant minister or a (layman) Professor (actually the same individual). In the first study, just one measure (Allport's intrinsic motivation scale) revealed a significant difference, while in the other two studies, no differences emerged. Results are discussed in terms of the difficulty of interpreting negative findings. It is argued that until experimenter effects in studies on religion are clearly demonstrated, the best approach would seem to be one of skepticism that such effects exist."
402;1982;"To investigate the relation between intense experiences and mysticism, four different methods were used in Finland. These are based on the methods which R. W. Hood has used in USA, and my results and Hood's show great similarities. ""The religious interpretation factor"" has in my material, too, a remarkable penetration. The other factor, ""the general mysticism factor,"" is more difficult to isolate but subsumes experiences implying ego loss, the experience of unity and the emergence into something greater than the individual self. A new interview coding model, situation-influence, gave new perspectives to the affective transformation some of the intensive experiences undergo."
403;1982;"Upon encountering an unconventional belief system, people are often heard to exclaim: ""How could anyone in his right mind believe such nonsense?"" This sentiment is not restricted to the layperson. A more subtle version of it is featured in some of the social scientific literature on religious cults an movements. As such, it gives rise to explanations of cult or movement viability that are premised on an assumption that unconventional religious beliefs are highly vulnerable to everyday experience and therefore inherently fragile. This assumption prompts some scholars to propose the existence of elaborate ""plausibility structures"" that are presumably required to maintain the tenuous beliefs and to protect their respective adherents from cognitive dissonance. This paper challenges the view that unconventional belief systems are necessarily fragile and owe their persistence primarily to the power of plausibility structures. It is also argued that such assumptions can function as barriers to understanding of contemporary religious movements and other unconventional beliefs."
404;1982;"Using a sample of 711 white home-owners drawn from the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex in 1981, this investigation examined the relation between media religiosity (i.e., the ""electronic"" church) and various demographic factors as well as its relation with church religiosity, religious orthodoxy, and civil religious sentiments. Consumers of the ""electronic"" church were found to be most likely older, female, blue-collar, long-time Texas residents, with less than college education and more children under the age of six years. Multivariate analysis showed church religiosity to be the best predictor of media religiosity among fundamentalists but religious orthodoxy to be the best predictor among moderates and conservatives. Civil religion was related to media religiosity only among certain moderate denominations' members. Inspection of actual reported viewing indicates that the ""electronic"" church is attracting in general only theologically fundamentalist and conservative Christians who are more interested in religious, as opposed to civil or political, messages."
405;1982;What circumstances permit churches to organize for innovative social change? A recent example of a clergy-led social movement following an industrial crisis in Youngstown, Ohio is examined utilizing a resource mobilization perspective. In this case the local community was mobilized against a predatory conglomerate, using resources from the federal government, the churches and Washington-based economic planners. The movement was able effectively to neutralize possible sources of opposition within the community and within the constituent church organizations.
406;1983;A formulation, general attribution theory, is presented and applied to the problem of God-attribution. Hypothesizing that religious attributions are a function of situational and stylistic factors, the present work deals with event-character and contextual influences which are aspects of the former. Twelve short stories picturing positive or negative social, economic, and medical occurrences varying in importance were written. In our initial experiment, these were administered under personal or impersonal-reference conditions to 135 respondents. The degree to which God was seen as involved in each happening was assessed. A four-factor ANOVA revealed God attributions varied meaningfully with event-domain, positive-negativeness, and event-importance. Significant interactions among these factors and with the personal-impersonal condition were also observed. In our second experiment, an experimental manipulation of a personal-impersonal experimental condition produced evidence that more God attributions result in personal than impersonal circumstances. An attempt to assess the effect of a church vs. a nonchurch context resulted in negative findings and recommends the necessity of making this potential source of influence more salient in future work. The utility of attributional concepts to explain much religious activity is increasingly apparent.
407;1983;"A preliminary theory of death transcendence is proposed that neither assumes that persons are pervasively motivated to ""deny death"" nor that immortality is conceptually or empirically impossible. Using categories from Lifton's work, five cognitive modes of death transcendence are proposed, the creative, nature, biosocial, religious, and mysticism. Scales to measure these modes were devised based on factor analysis of items in a large sample (N = 587). These scales were subsequently correlated with Spilka's Fear of Death scales in one sample (N = 342), and with Spilka's death perspective and the Allport and Ross intrinsic/extrinsic scales in another sample (N = 105). In a final study, interviews with a sample of older adults (N = 39) allowed categorization of participants on each of Lifton's categories and these were correlated with intrinsic/extrinsic religiosity and Spilka's Death perspective scales. In all samples, meaningful patterns of correlations were obtained indicating the usefulness of our preliminary theoretical concerns. A cognitive theory of death transcendence in opposition to widely postulated ""denial"" theories seems fruitful. In addition, the special linkage between cognitive modes of death transcendence and mysticism is discussed."
408;1983;"A study of 3,247 United Church of Christ congregations assessed the explanatory power of numerous factors for growth or decline in 1970-78. Overall decline was 10.4%. Larger churches declined proportionately more than small churches; city churches declined markedly while small town and rural churches remained stable. Recently established churches grew the most. Congregational youthfulness was a key institutional factor; younger congregations grew more. Community contextual factors accounted for 51% of the explained variance in growth or decline, and institutional factors accounted for 49%. Some institutional factors are not changeable by intentional action, and if they are removed, changeable institutional factors accounted for 33% of the variance. It is argued that future researchers should distinguish between two types of institutional factors in order to clarify the current debate over factors in church growth."
409;1983;Beginning with a review of the theoretical and empirical work on invisible religion, the author proceeds to use Canadian national data to identify a number of conventional and unconventional themes which might characterize meaning systems in that country. The extent to which these themes are associated with the immanent level in the form of sphere integration and the ultimate level in the form of answers to ultimate questions is then examined. While many Canadians exhibit highly integrated lives, many do not. Significantly, integration -- when it does appear -- is not highly associated with the posited meaning system themes. Decisive answers to ultimate questions are predictably more common for people with religious versus humanist meaning systems. The author concludes that the assertion that all people have to have meaning systems may be erroneous, with the social scientific search for such systems possibly largely a futile one.
410;1983;Brainwashing and drift models of religious conversion appear contradictory, but each carries a partial truth, and both rely on a faulty model of socialization as internalization. We offer a revised conception of socialization (the creation and incorporation of novices in a group) as a resource for integrating those models and explaining how strong proselytization and weak commitment are joined in cult conversion. Using the new conception to analyze Moonie socialization, we show that their recent success resulted from combining strong social incorporation of converts with weak creation of new belief systems, a pattern which simultaneously fostered strong initial commitment and created blocks to long-term affiliation. Applied to the study of conversion, this concept of socialization suggests new research strategies and generates new questions to be investigated.
411;1983;"Contrary to prevailing paradigms of modernization and secularization, I contend that extremism is the religious norm, and that it is not religious extremism but religious moderation that requires explanation. Relying on impressions from contemporary Judaism, extremism is defined here as the desire to expand the scope, detail and strictness of religious law; social isolation; and the rejection of the surrounding culture. Religious extremism is an impulse or an orientation which, when objectified in persons and institutions, is invariably moderated. Religious moderation can be accounted for by the mixed motivations of religious adherents, either individuals or groups, who temper their ""religious"" impulses in order to achieve ""non-religious"" goals at the individual or communal level. Religious moderation may be a strategy to persuade or convert others, or to protect the religious community itself against a hostile environment. In all instances, moderation is associated with religious prestige and strong communal commitments. The decline of the religious community permits the breakthrough of extremist tendencies. This is facilitated by the decline of the secular culture with which the religious moderates were associated. This theory is applied to two types of Jewish religious extremism in Israel, one anti-nationalist and the other ultra-nationalist in orientation."
412;1983;"Disaffiliation from fast-growing religious organizations has received comparatively little research attention. Yet, all groups do experience some loss of membership either through members leaving to join other religions or through their termination of formal religious involvement altogether. We examine patterns of religious disaffiliation from the Mormon Church by focusing on religious attitudes and behavior of former Mormons and by comparing them with currently affiliated Mormons (both lifelong members and converts) and with members of other major religious groups. The most typical pattern of disaffiliation for Mormons is to ""drop out"" of religious participation altogether. Disaffiliates of all types (including those who switch to another religious faith) exhibit lower levels of religiosity than do both lifelong Mormons and Mormon converts."
413;1983;"Following a brief review of recent literature dealing with the Mary cult, this article focuses on one aspect of that cult: Marian apparitions. Investigation of 50 well-documented apparitions of the Virgin Mary between 1100-1896 and this indicates that 1) Marian apparitions are as likely to occur to males as females; 2) seers are likely to be sexually mature individuals who lack obvious sexual partners; and 3) Italy has always accounted for a disproportionate share of such seers. Following Freud, it is argued that apparitions result from the blocking of sexual impulses. These blocked sexual impulses reactivate infantile impulses long since repressed, and it is these reactivated infantile impulses that determine the content of an apparition. Marian apparitions in particular are produced by the intensification of certain aspects of the Oedipal process. Specifically, males find in the Marian apparitions an ideal way of sublimating their intense sexual desire for the mother, and females find in such apparitions a way of sublimating their sexual desire for the father. This explanation is capable of accounting for all the patterns described previously. However, relative infrequency of Marian apparitions in Spain, which has a family structure similar to that found in Italy, is an anomaly with respect to the interpretation developed here, and that anomaly is discussed. Finally, the interpretation presented here suggests that there should be systematic differences between the Marian apparitions experienced by males and those experienced by females, and those differences do appear in the data."
414;1983;"In recent years, support for the deprogramming of cult converts has come from a small body of research. This study examines one of the better known anti-cult investigations, the Conway and Siegelman claims of deleterious influence resulting from cult affiliation. Using their reported data, there was no statistical support for their claims of ""information disease."" In fact, the only significant correlations that emerged from the data tended to support a ""therapeutic"" view of some cult affiliation."
415;1983;"Participation-observation with four Spiritualist groups uncovered some institutional patterns apparently amenable to the exercise of authority by women: the Spiritualist preference for non-professional helping, of a spiritual and quasi-medical kind, provides a specific alternative to conventional definitions of authority; the role of the seeker offers a more active model for relating to self and to community than the more passive stereotype of femininity; and mediumship as a style of spiritual leadership grants greater initiative to followers than do most models of clerical authority. Maintaining a deviant gender-authority pattern is enhanced by the centrality of mild trance states to worship. Unconventionality, in belief and identity, has positive consequences in defending Spiritualists psychologically from the dominance of patriarchal patterns otherwise in society. These choices, while not obviously radical in themselves, offer resources for establishing and perpetuating a feminine style of religious authority within the movement."
416;1983;Prior research on the linkage between religiosity and self-esteem has produced inconsistent findings. The model tested in this paper suggests that church attendance and other dimensions of religiosity affect both self-esteem and attitudes toward other people. The dependent variables are Rosenberg's Self Esteem and Faith in People (misanthropy) scales. Independent variables include parental social class, family solidarity, measures of personal school achievement, church attendance, and religious preference. Data were collected in 1977 as part of a replication of surveys of the midwestern community of Middletown done by Robert and Helen Lynd in the 1920s. Subjects were randomly selected high school students (Total N = 1,673, but because there were alternate forms of the instrument the actual N for testing the proposed model is about 500). Findings reveal little relationship between religiosity and self-esteem, but church attendance is significantly related to faith in people.
417;1983;Roof's (1972, 1976, 1978) local-cosmopolitan theory of religious commitment is tested using a population of Catholic brothers and nuns living in West Tennessee. The findings provide rather strong support for Roof's theory. Local community reference (localism) had appreciable positive effects on seven religious belief and behavioral variables. Moreover, localism played a role (albeit a limited one) in mediating the effects of education, size of hometown, and length of residence on the religiosity variables. The implications of the findings for the generalizability of the theory are discussed.
418;1983;"Since God is generally viewed as a personal Being in our culture, attributing responsibility to God may follow the same principles as attributing responsibility to any personal source. But, given varying beliefs in God, individual religious differences may also influence attribution. In keeping with the person attribution literature, college students were found to see God as more responsible for extremely good outcomes. But this was true only for those feeling Near God and when outcomes were unlikely rather than likely. Fundamentalists and persons Near God rated God as more responsible than did other people. Only minor support occurred for a ""God of the gaps"" theology. The occurrence of simultaneous attributions to God and people and the impact of beliefs on attributions suggest that the person attribution approach needs broadening."
419;1983;"The ""Religious Orientation"" scale (Allport & Ross, 1967) has been widely used with adults to measure Allport's Extrinsic (E) and Intrinsic (I) religious orientations. Being designed for adults, the existing form is probably not suitable for evaluating religious orientations with children and young adolescents because of the reading comprehension level required. This article presents the development of an ""Age Universal"" form of the Religious Orientation scale. Results indicated that alpha internal reliability coefficients for Age Universal I and E scales are as high as those of the original scales. Correlations between original and rewritten forms of both I and E were as high as they possibly can be given the alpha reliabilities. Further analyses indicate that the Age Universal I-E scale is usable, with certain precautions, with both children (fifth grade and above) and adults."
420;1983;"The assumption that superior growth among Conservative churches since the mid-1960s has included noteworthy recruitment of the unchurched is again examined. Having previously found that over 90% of the 1966-70 additions to twenty Conservative churches in ""the Canadian Bible Belt"" were internal, we return to those same churches in the face of claims that evangelical outreach has accelerated in the 1970s and 80s. While the churches have changed, recruitment patterns have remained largely the same. An analysis of the proselytes reveals that most continue to be young people, recruited through friendship and family ties. Variations in pathway proportions are accounted for by differentiating regional and neighborhood churches, and further taking their ecological environments into account. We conclude that these findings for Canada support the secularization thesis and, rather than being anomalous, are to be expected in all highly industrialized societies."
421;1983;The effect of religion on serious felony crimes has been a neglected area of criminological research. The present investigation performs an exploratory analysis of the impact of Catholicism on forcible rape. Data are collected and analyzed for the fifty states. A theory relating low religious involvement to relatively high crime rates is constructed from the standpoint of Durkheim's social integration theory of deviance. Control variables are introduced from major alternative theories of crime. These include the economic, deterrence, age roles, and urbanization theories of criminal behavior. The results of a multiple regression analysis indicate that controlling for the other variables, the greater the percent Catholic the lower the rate of rape. In addition, an assessment of the beta coefficients found that the religious factor was the condition most closely associated with the variance in forcible rape. This finding is interpreted from the standpoint of the greater sexual regulation found among Catholics in such areas as birth control, premarital sex, and abortion. Such regulation discourages sexual deviancy, including rape. Other factors significantly related to the incidence of rape include the rate of unemployment, extent of urbanization, and a state's rate of alcoholism. The model explains 55 percent of the variance in rape.
422;1983;"The major question addressed in this paper is why people have a favorable attitude toward the moral majority. The theoretical model predicted that moral majority support would be positively related to having a Christian Right orientation, to being opposed to change, and to watching religious television; in turn, it was predicted that the latter three variables would be negatively related to modernity characteristics. Data came from a stratified, staged-random sample of residents of the SMSA containing Muncie, Indiana, the Lynd's ""Middletown"" (N = 281). It was found that moral majority support had three independent sources: 1) persuasion via religious television; 2) a cultural fundamentalist attitude stressing continuation of the status quo; and 3) advocacy of the Christian Right perspective. Two of these factors are negatively related to modernity variables suggesting long-term decline in support for the moral majority."
423;1983;The religious geography of America is characterized by an east-west split. Metropolitan church membership rates in the Mountain and Pacific states are substantially lower than in the rest of the country. This paper accounts for this difference by developing two opposing models of community structure. The linear development model predicts that urbanization and population density are negatively associated with metropolitan church membership rates. The systemic model predicts that population instability and migration are more important determinants of community religious commitment. Analysis shows that migration variables are more important in predicting church commitment. Further, when regional rates are adjusted for migration, the regional differences in church membership are greatly reduced.
424;1983;This paper reconsiders the impact of religion on suicide, a topic first raised by Durkheim in 1897. We look first at Durkheim's argument and find it inconsistent and unconvincing. Moreover, we find that for a scholar revered as a founding father of the sociology of religion, Durkheim was amazingly uninformed and misleading about elementary features of religion in 19th century Europe. We then empirically test Durkheim's major assertions using contemporary data for American SMSAs. We find a potent religious effect, but no denominational differences. That is, high rates of church membership are associated with low suicide rates, whether those members mainly are Protestants or Catholics. We do find support for Durkheim's claim that a lack of social integration produces suicide. But, contrary to Durkheim, religious effects cannot be reduced to those of social integration -- with integration controlled powerful religious effects persist. In a postscript we integrate our work with that of Whitney Pope (1976), whose devastating critique of Durkheim even cast doubt on the existence of differential Prostestant-Catholic suicide rates in 19th century Europe. Pope's position is not only strongly supported by the findings we report here, but also by other work we have done using American data from as long ago as 1906.
425;1983;This study analyzes two Caribbean pilgrimage types: fixed and flexible. Fixed pilgrimages (pilgrimages with specific destinations) are represented by the annual pilgrimage to Saut d'Eau in Haiti. Flexible pilgrimages (pilgrimages without specific destinations) are represented by the journeys sponsored by an indigenous Caribbean religion, the Spiritual Baptists of Trinidad. Both fixed and flexible pilgrimages may be found throughout the Caribbean region, but on each Caribbean island a particular type of pilgrimage dominates. Differences in pilgrimage types reflect attitudes toward the land, mobility of the gods, and national sentiments. Attitudes toward the land, however, was found to be the most important factor. This study concludes that fixed pilgrimages, such as the annual pilgrimage to Saut d'Eau, fit the model of pilgrimage behavior developed by Victor Turner, but that flexible pilgrimages, such as Spiritual Baptist journeys in Trinidad, do not fit Turner's model.
426;1983;"This study employs the exchange and phenomenological perspectives in social theory to develop an empirical and analytical account of the relationship between religious commitment and parental adjustment following childhood death. This was accomplished in two ways: 1) by exploring the influence of religious commitment on bereavement adjustment as well as changes in commitment resulting from religion's effectiveness as a source of comfort; and 2) by examining the nature and effectiveness of theodicies constructed by parents to explain their child's death. In-depth interviews and questionnaires were used to gather data from 145 parents of children, treated for cancer or blood disorders at a large urban pediatric hospital, who died during 1975-79. Results showed that religious commitment is both cause and consequence of adjustment to bereavement in that religion can serve as a source of compensation for the loss of a child. Moreover, the analysis revealed the existence of three specific types of bereavement theodicies: 1) reunion with the child in an afterlife; 2) the child's death as serving a noble purpose; and 3) the death as a punishment for parental wrong-doing. The implications of these results for understanding the role of religion in the mourning process are discussed."
427;1983;This study examines the relationship between religious affiliation and psychiatric diagnoses in a sample of 7050 patients at a mid-western psychiatric clinic (1977-80). Seven major and thirty-three specific religious groups are compared according to nine major and forty-four specific DSM II psychiatric diagnostic categories. The major finding is that under emotional stress, affiliates of major and specific religious groups tend to experience psychiatric disorder in different ways. Using the top third Chi-square values for both major and specific groups, a psychiatric profile is provided for each religious group in which significantly strong and weak diagnoses are rank ordered.
428;1983;This study examines the utility of a multidimensional scale of formal authority in assessing the relationship of denominational structure and local church activities. The scale is compared with two typologies of formal polity which are often used in studying religious organizations, and is found to have greater predictive power and more potential to discriminate between denominations than either of the typologies. The analysis includes a discussion of how congregational/denominational power relationships might affect local church participation in different sectors of the local interorganizational network.
429;1983;"This study investigates the effects of religious and ethnic identification on the full migration/return-migration cycle. The analysis goes beyond the standard ""push-pull"" migration factors to account for the variables associated with remaining or returning. Data were derived from a multiphase research project including 1) a panel survey of American immigrants in Israel, and 2) interviews with persons seriously considering living in Israel or who had migrated to Israel after 1967 and returned subsequently to the United States. These data, together with data from the 1971 National Jewish Population Survey, confirm previous research findings that the motivation for migration is tied primarily to a strong sense of Jewish religious and ethnic identification and some estrangement from both the American Jewish and the larger communities. However, the decision whether to remain in Israel or return to the United States rests on another complex array of variables which does not include religious identification."
430;1983;Three aspects of Allport's original concept of mature religion appear to be omitted from his later, highly-popular concept of religion as an intrinsic end in itself. These aspects are (a) readiness to face existential questions without reducing their complexity, (b) perception of religious doubts as positive, and (c) openness to future change in one's religious views. Batson and Ventis claim that these three aspects are included in Batson's concept of religion as a quest. Consistent with this claim, evidence is presented which indicates that the quest orientation correlates positively with greater cognitive complexity in dealing with existential concerns, while the intrinsic, end orientation does not.
431;1983;"While there has been much discussion of the decline in institutionalized religion in recent decades, there has been little work on the consequences of such a decline. This study adopts a social integration/regulation perspective that predicts a rise in suicide from the decline in institutionalized religion. Using Cochrane-Orcutt iterative regression procedures, the investigation links the decline of religion, measured in church attendance, with a rise in suicide. The religious factor tends to be more closely associated with suicide than the rate of unemployment, a control taken from one of the dominant paradigms on suicide. The decline in religion was most closely associated with the suicide rate of young adults, the group with the greatest decline in church attendance. To 1978, the analysis suggests that any alleged increase in ""invisible religion"" had not been adequate to offset the effect of the fall in institutionalized religion on suicide. While the fall in church attendance was the most important factor associated with rising suicide rates, the rate of unemployment and military participation were also significant."
432;1984;"A study of forty-five ex-members of three highly controversial new religious movements was conducted in order to assess post-involvement attitudes toward the group. Though much has been written or said about ex-members who later claim to have been victims of ""mind control"" or ""brainwashing,"" a closer investigation of such claims indicates that they are based primarily on accounts by persons exiting with the assistance of deprogramming/exit therapy, or studies that combine accounts of voluntary and deprogrammed persons. This study explores the responses of voluntary defectors (i.e., those who leave without the aid of deprogramming or some comparable therapeutic treatment) and finds a relative absence of brainwashing claims or accusations. Most voluntary defectors say they feel ""wiser for the experience,"" and say they were members by their own choice. Implications of findings are discussed."
433;1984;"Among modern Western religions, Mormon belief is quite distinctive in its inclusion of a Heavenly Mother figure among its divine personages. This paper examines some of the historical and theological background of the Mormon ""Mother in Heaven."" We assess different explanations accounting for this belief and show its logical consistency with other aspects of Mormon doctrine. Further, we look at the politics associated with the Mother In Heaven belief which bear on feminist issues among Mormons. In recent times we find that the existence of a divine female has become a rallying symbol for some Mormon feminists within an incipient ""grass roots"" movement aimed at acquiring greater power and equality within the church. We note how this belief in a female deity has primarily functioned in conservative ways to sustain certain institutional ends rather than feminist concerns. Considering the prospects for change in Mormonism's position on the role of women, we conclude that the presence of a goddess in the pantheon is no guarantee of sexual equality in the real world."
434;1984;By and large, the reaction to the activities and pronouncements of the New Christian Right has been strongly negative. Emerging out of the reaction are various accusations that Evangelical Christianity represents a serious threat to the liberal traditions of democratic tolerance. Few attempts, however, have been made to measure this reaction against empirical evidence. This essay attempts to do just this for an important sub-population within Evangelicalism -- a national sample of students attending Evangelical colleges and seminaries -- those who will represent the lay and professional leadership of Evangelicalism in the coming generation. The broader implications of the Evangelical case are then discussed.
435;1984;Data from a comprehensive survey of the populations of three states were used to estimate a path model that examined the effects of geographic mobility and social integration on church attendance. Results of this analysis suggest geographic mobility inhibits attendance indirectly through disrupting an individual's network of social ties and bonds of community attachment. These results support the widely-accepted integration-disruption hypothesis. Mobility also exerts a modest direct effect on attendance. It is suggested that this relationship requires further examination.
436;1984;Drug use by adolescents is a widespread phenomena in American society and is seen as sufficiently problematic to have generated a great deal of research over the past twenty years. Some of this research has investigated the role of religion in discouraging drug use and has generally found that religious involvement does have a negative effect on the tendency to use alcohol, marijuana and other illicit drugs. Yet many unanswered questions remain and the complexity of the relationship has been largely ignored. This paper is based on interviews with 600 adolescents attending public school in the Atlanta, Georgia area and seeks to examine the relationship between religious involvement and drug/alcohol use. The analysis is conducted within a multivariate context in order to determine the role of religion over against other mechanisms of social control. Findings indicate that even when controlling for other important influences, religion still has a significant effect on alcohol use, drug use and attitudes toward drug use. The importance of religion as a predictor variable, however, varies according to the substance involved, reflecting the degree to which the church speaks alone against the activity or in concert with other sources of social control.
437;1984;"Eight hundred and thirty-six introductory psychology students completed a 15-page questionnaire relating primarily to religious orientation and background. A factor structure and multiple regression analysis previously reported by Hunsberger (1980) in predicting apostasy was essentially confirmed. An expanded analysis indicated that an intellectual orientation and the emphasis placed on religion in the childhood home were the two factors which served as the best predictors of apostate/nonapostate status in a multiple regression analysis. Further descriptive self-report information indicated that respondents perceived ""home"" to be a relatively important influence in their religious development. In particular, respondents reported that their parents, especially the mother, had been influential in affecting their religious orientation."
438;1984;Members of three sectarian groups (Catholic Charismatics, Christian Scientists, and Baha'is) were studied in terms of their perceptions of the number, types and reactions to crises they had experienced. It was hypothesized that ideological and structural differences between groups would result in differential perceptions of and adaptations to crises. It was found that the groups did not differ in the number of crises reported by members. Further, in all but a few cases, definitions of types of crises experienced were a function of member characteristics rather than group affiliation. We found, however, that sectarian differences exert a consistent effect regardless of member characteristics on reactions to crises.
439;1984;"Nunn (1964) presented data to give limited support to the thesis that in order to secure compliance from their children, powerless parents tell them ""God will punish them if they misbehave."" Youths who subscribe to this belief have higher levels of self-blame and greater feeling they should be obedient than youths who do not. Using data from Minnesota children in grades four through eight, we find little support for the hypothesis that it is powerless parents who use this technique. However, like Nunn, we find the belief that ""God punishes youths who are bad"" is positively associated with self-blame and obedience. We introduce an additional variable, i.e., subscribing in general to the image of God as punishing or angry. Using this variable in relation to the belief that ""God punishes youths who are bad"" gives four cells, one of which is the image of God as angry/punishing but rejecting the belief that ""God punishes youths who are bad"" (this combination is one of a malevolent but impersonal God.). Youths subscribing to this combination have the lowest levels of self-blame and feeling of obedience to parents. Our findings agree with Nunn's linkage of parental ""coalition with God"" and the child's benevolent image of God; the malevolent view is linked with a lower level of internalization."
440;1984;Previous research has found that religious involvement is a multidimensional phenomenon. The present study tested this hypothesis by having members of the Mennonite Church complete the 1968 Questionnaire (1968Q) developed and used in the King and Hunt investigations (1972a, 1975.) Factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis of the 1968Q items resulted in the extraction of seven factors: Personal Faith, Intolerance of Ambiguity: Revised, Orthodoxy, Social Conscience, Knowledge of Religious History, Life Purpose, and Church Involvement. Minimal support was found for the King and Hunt dimensions (1972a, 1975). No overlapping items on the factors and acceptable reliability data were found for the factors.
441;1984;Previous research has neglected an important area of inquiry, the relationship of religiosity and psychological well-being. The present study attempts to rectify this deficiency. It examines this relationship using data from the 1972-1982 NORC General Social Survey (Davis, 1972). Focusing on the issue of race, the sample was broken down into blacks and whites. Religiosity was found to be a better predictor of well-being than previous research had indicated. Religiosity did especially well in predicting the well-being of black men and women.
442;1984;"Religion in Iceland provides the focus for a historical-comparative and participant observation study of the supposed ""irrelevance"" of religion in secular society. The judgment of irrelevance appears to depend largely on a peculiar definitional construct, formed with little immediate connection to the experience of the participants in the system. A situational definition grounded in the participants' understandings of their own actions produces a rather different assessment of the religio-social systems under investigation. When people act in ways they define as religious, religion must be accepted as ""real"" for social-scientific analysis. On this basis judgments of the irrelevance of Scandinavian religion are premature and one-sided, with predefined ""functions"" of religion in society skewing both research and theory."
443;1984;Religious denominations are viewed as indicators of regional cultural distinctiveness in the United States. Census-type adherence data for 1952, 1971, and 1980 are used to examine changes in spatial concentration within religious groups, and in relation to general population trends. Contrary to expectations, for both the 1952-1971 and 1971-1980 periods these broadly representative denominational data exhibit remarkable stability rather than change. The implications of these patterns for future research on religious trends and their impact on regional culture are discussed.
444;1984;Social movement organization research is criticized for neglecting the analysis of the local social contexts in which SMOs are located and the interpretation of these contexts by SMO members and leaders. The development of two Jesus groups is compared and accounted for by focusing on these factors. The groups began with strong internal similarities as aggressive, outward-focused, task-oriented, Jesus movement groups. The Urban Group maintained its original characteristics, but the Suburban Group underwent changes in goals, leadership, organization, and tactics. The divergence between the groups is explained by differences in their local social contexts: 1) local resources, including membership base, leadership base, and tangible resources and 2) the symbolic environment, including values of members, perceptions of local needs, potential responses of locals to various tactics, and efficiency of various tactics given local conditions. Internal group characteristics are found to be more dependent on the group's interaction with its local context than determinants of the nature of this interaction.
445;1984;"The norms that underly the development of science in seventeenth century England have been the subject of much study. Robert Merton, a pioneer in the field of the sociology of science, has also identified norms that are currently important in the ""ethos of science."" However, the current normative structure of science can only be accounted for by developments in the 19th century which modified the earlier norms emphasizing the power of reason. Herbert Spencer, one of the 19th century developers of the new discipline of the social sciences, discussed in detail the human perceptual problem, emphasizing the negative effect of bias on the understanding of social facts. His treatment of bias is reviewed in this article and is shown to be analogous to a theological view of sin. The serious and pervasive effects of bias are explored. Bias is seen as subtly associated with positive social forces. The antidotes of disciplined thought and self-criticism are recommended. This secularized view of sin provides a basis for the kinds of norms identified by Merton and for developments in social scientific methodology."
446;1984;The persistent sex differential in church attendance found by many researchers has often been attributed to differential labor force participation. Using 1980 survey data from the National Opinion Research Center, this paper explores the effect of workforce status of women on their church attendance. While there is indeed a statistically significant mean attendance differential between working and nonworking women, it is not due to coefficient differences in the explanatory variables, but is due to differences in the mean values of certain of the significant explanatory variables, particularly religious intensity, spouse of the same denomination, age, presence of young children in the household, and membership in non-mainline denominations. Thus, the rise in female labor force participation cannot generate long term projections of declining attendance on that basis alone.
447;1984;"The purpose of this study is to test whether national patterns of Jewish identification indicate a ""polarization"" trend (i.e., increased identification among younger Orthodox Jews and decreased identification among younger Reform and non-denominational Jews). Using data from the National Jewish Population Study we found mixed results regarding the polarization hypothesis. Our findings show that by the fourth generation Orthodoxy seems to be maintaining its numbers while the dropout rate from Conservative and Reform Judaism substantially increases the proportion of non-denominational Jews for the first time. However, age trends within denominational and generational groups do not show any clear trend toward either greater or less identification among younger Jews. The implications of the various changes and trends discovered are explored in detail and the similarities to changes in Protestant denominational affilations are discussed."
448;1984;"This paper considers a number of conceptual and methodological ambiguities in the empirical study of culture change as exemplified in Robert Wuthnow's ""The Consciousness Reformation."" Difficulties arise from the failure to distinguish between collective and individual-level manifestation of culture, and from the tendency to ignore the variable role of interacting collectivities for the development of symbol systems and their ability to affect behavior. An attempt is made to clarify ambiguities and replicate Wuthnow's findings using data from a sample of individuals who were members of communes inspired by social movements of the late 1960s. Participants in communal movements were overwhelmingly young and adhered to ""non-traditional"" worldviews, indicating a possible cultural shift. However, affiliation with a specific ideological group had greater influence on activism than cognitive framework as such. The importance of self-conscious ideological communities for the process of cultural change is discussed."
449;1984;This paper examines the characteristics of female religious commitment by focusing on conversion to and disaffection from nontraditional religious movements. The seventeen subjects in the study represent a wide variety of religious orientations, ranging from charismatic Christianity to Eastern mysticism, with their commitment varying over time from six weeks to ten years. Data for the study were collected through in-depth interviews that explored the subject's initial involvement with the group, the process of conversion, and the social-psychological aspects of deconversion. The analysis suggests that in religious commitment an economy of love is operationalized in which the commodities of exchange are affection, approval, and intimacy. As such, the male religious hierarchy plays a significant role in the lives of female converts through control over the emotional rewards of religious commitment. Such control often leads to sexual exploitation, abuse, and discrimination, sources of female subordination that are reinforced by the pervasiveness of romantic ideals, expectations of male protection and love which come to dominate the interaction between the female devotee and the male leadership. Through the trauma of rejection, the romantic ideal is ultimately destroyed, creating the conditions under which the devotee begins to perceive an imbalance in the emotional exchange relationship. Because of the sense of violation that many of the women have experienced, they choose to leave the movement rather than to attempt to redress the imbalance through a continued association with the religious group.
450;1984;"This study analyzes changes in leaders' commitment rhetoric over the 150 year history of the Mormon Church. Categories of commitment are derived from Rosabeth Kanter's study of 19th century utopian groups; these include: sacrifice, investment, renunciation, communion, mortification and transcendence. Commitment rhetoric is measured by calculating ""salience scores"" based on a content analysis of a representative sample of Mormon General Conference addresses. Major findings are: 1) There are consistent differences in the relative salience of commitment categories, but the ordering of these differences changes over time. 2) Transcendence is by far the most salient category of commitment rhetoric during every period of Mormon history. 3) There is a pronounced curvilinear relationship between all categories of commitment and the passage of time. The historical and theoretical applications of these findings are discussed, particularly with regard to the adaptive transformations of social movements."
451;1984;"This study evaluated the comprehensibility of six versions of the Bible. The subjects were 324 undergraduates from a Christian liberal arts college in the eastern United States. The experimental design included three independent variables: biblical version (King James Version, Revised Standard Version, New English Bible, Today's English Version, the Living Bible, New International Version); theological orthodoxy (liberal, conservative); and type of literature (narrative, poetry, proclamation). Two dependent variables, comprehensibility ratings (seven-point scale) and recall proportions (number of textual units recalled as a percentage of the total possible) were investigated. A 6 × 2 × 3 analysis of variance revealed a main effect for biblical versions and type of literature on both dependent variables. The KJV was judged to be less comprehensible than each of the modern versions, and the LB and TEV were judged to be more comprehensible than either the RSV or NEB. Moreover, the LB and NIV facilitated recall better than the KJV. For all versions, proclamation literature was judged to be more comprehensible than either poetry or narrative literature, and narrative literature facilitated better recall than either poetry or proclamation literature. No difference was found between liberals and conservatives on either dependent variable."
452;1984;"Two conceptual models have been proposed to describe changes in religious commitment among regional migrants. The ""dislocation"" model predicts that all migrants undergo a decline in commitment after being uprooted from familiar surroundings; the ""adaptation"" model asserts that commitment among migrants will rise or fall depending on their new region's norms of religious behavior. This paper tests these models through an examination of patterns of church attendance and strength of adherence within national samples of white and black Baptists, and white Lutherans, Methodists and Catholics in the United States. Findings confirm the adaptation model's prediction that religious commitment rises among migrants to regions of higher native commitment, such as the South, and falls among migrants to regions of lower commitment, such as the West. These results suggest that, contrary to expectation, migration may contribute to the persistence of regional religious differences in the United States."
453;1984;"Two hundred and eighty-four residents of the Lynd's ""Middletown"" (Muncie, Indiana) were interviewed to test a path model of possible direct and indirect antecedents of support for the Moral Majority. The results indicated a Christian Right orientation, cultural ethnocentrism, and authoritarianism had a major impact on Moral Majority support. Respondent's education and age, and religious television had a secondary influence. Possible explanations for a revised path model were discussed."
454;1984;Using data from over 2,000 students attending one of ten colleges ranging from secular-public to exclusively Christian, we investigate: 1) variation in Evangelical beliefs, 2) the relationship of Evangelical beliefs to other dimensions of the Evangelical worldview, and 3) the impact of college context on that worldview. While more Evangelical students are found at the more Evangelical campuses, the religious outlook of their counterparts at less Evangelical campuses appears not to be threatened but, indeed, may be stronger. The argument that the plausibility of minority religious viewpoints is relatively easily maintained is thus supported, though at the cost of adopting an admittedly defensive posture.
455;1984;"While the social network analytic approach has gained increasing popularity, it has been employed rather infrequently in the study of the social organization of religious groups. This study uses the ""blockmodel"" analytic approach developed by H. C. White and his collaborators (1975, 1976a) to examine and interpret patterns both within and across social networks of members of a small Anglican congregation. The blockmodel interpretation of the data, coupled with in-depth interviews with each respondent, identifies two opposing groups, each struggling for supremacy within the church. Group 1 (the Reformers), containing the minister and young to middle aged congregational members, support changes to ""modernize"" the church. Group 2 (the Conservatives), containing older members who have attended a greater number of years, support adherence to traditional ideology, prayerbook and hymns. Group 3 (the Followers), containing young congregational members, are not actually involved in the conflict between the two groups, but passively support Group 1 with its liberal views. Blockmodel analysis proves a valuable tool for understanding the social structure of religious groups."
456;1985;"A formal theory demonstrating the applicability of attribution concepts and research findings to the psychology of religion is developed and discussed. First, an overview of attribution theory is presented, wherein it is argued that three basic needs or desires of people -- viz., for a sense of meaning, for control over outcomes, and for self-esteem -- are evident throughout the attribution process; this trichotomy of motives provides a basic framework upon which the structure of the theory is based. It is maintained that religious and naturalistic meaning-belief systems often exist concurrently within a person's world view, and that specific factors can be identified which predict whether a religious or a non-religious explanation of an event will be made in a particular case. These factors are discussed in terms of four broad categories: characteristics of the attributor, the attributor's context, characteristics of the event, and the event's context. Specific examples developed within each of these categories provide links to the existing research literature of the psychology of religion, as well as a wide range of testable empirical hypotheses for future research."
457;1985;After reviewing research by Roof, Mol and Kaill, this paper examines relationships among the following explanatory variables: theological conservatism, localism, authoritarianism/dogmatism, and civil liberalism. Using data drawn from members of three Protestant denominations in Australia, it is found that, of these four variables, theological conservatism is the best predictor of frequency of church attendance, degree of involvement in other church activities, views about ecumenism, attitudes to change in church structures and practices, and moral conservatism. But the other three explanatory variables are each more useful than theological conservatism in predicting degree of concern for social justice and degree of approval for church activism on social, political and economic issues. The four explanatory variables are all fairly weak predictors of political-economic conservatism. It is argued that the affects attributed to localism, authoritarianism/dogmatism or lack of civil liberalism can be explained by a more general concept, breadth of perspective. Modifications to Roof's theory are suggested: it is hypothesized that at least among Protestant church members, the impact of breadth of perspective decreases, and the salience of theological orientation increases, as the proportion of the total population which regularly participates in church-oriented religion decreases.
458;1985;Conversion/recruitment research has been guided for years by a traditional paradigm assuming a passive subject being converted by external powers over which no control is possible. The traditional model is also quite psychological and deterministic. A new or alternative paradigm has been developing, derived mainly from studies of recruitment to new religions. It posits a more active, meaning-seeking subject who exercises volition in deciding to convert to a new religion. The conflict between the new and the old paradigms is discussed including characterizing the so-called brainwashing model as a modern variant of the traditional paradigm. Also, the idea of an alternative conversion paradigm is contrasted to other theoretical perspectives from recent papers by Lofland and Skonovd and by Long and Hadden.
459;1985;"Despite the continuing importance of Marian apparitions within the Roman Catholic Mary Cult, few scholars have been concerned with explaining why these apparitions appear to some individuals and not to others. This article explores this question by considering in detail two particular Marian apparitions: the apparition seen by Maximin Giraud at LaSalette, France in 1846 and the apparition seen by Bernadette Soubirous at Lourdes, France in 1858. What makes these two cases especially interesting is that in neither instance was the ""lady"" seen by the seer initially identified as the Virgin Mary. On the contrary, analysis of the early reports associated with each apparition makes it highly likely that the apparition in each case was modeled on a parental figure (though not a natural parent) in the seer's background. Furthermore, examination of the childhood experiences of each seer make it highly likely that each seer's apparition was an attempt to gratify an unconscious desire associated with that parental figure. The psychodynamic explanation developed in each case is useful because it allows us to explain a wide range of observations associated with each apparition (e.g., why the lady at LaSalette was crying, why the lady at Lourdes identified herself as the Immaculate Conception, etc.)."
460;1985;Do individuals of differing religious orientations also differ in their philosophies of human nature? This question was examined by interviewing a representative sample of the adult population of Memphis, Tennessee. Altogether, 359 adults were questioned about their religious beliefs and practices, their answers yielding scores on four religious dimensions: Christian Orthodoxy, Church Involvement, Devotionalism and Theocracy. Respondents were also administered a revised version of Wrightsman's Philosophies of Human Nature Scale which produced scores on five dimensions: Cynicism, Internal Locus of Control, Goodness, Complexity and Variability. These two sets of measures were submitted to canonical correlation analysis. Two significant correlations were revealed, providing empirical support for the contention that people's religious outlook and their views of human nature are linked. The first canonical correlation of .35 (p < .001) suggested that people who adhere to orthodox Christian tenets, who make a habit of private devotions, and who are active in their churches see others as basically altruistic and truthful, hard to understand, and externally controlled. The second canonical correlation of .21 (p < .01) suggested that high levels of religious activism (in terms of participation in both church activities and private devotions) are associated with a belief in the uniformity of human nature. The demographic background of people exhibiting these patterns of belief was explored in an effort to interpret the correlations.
461;1985;Drawing from cognitive psychology theory, it was predicted that memory for religious messages would increase as a function of several variables: verbal ability, interest in the message, religiosity, and the consistency of the message with the religious beliefs of the subject. Three hundred fifty-three college students listened to one of three religious messages structurally similar, but thematically different: High God Control-Low Personal Control, High God Control-High Personal Control, and Low God Control-High Personal Control. They then completed several memory measures and other scales. Only modest amounts of information were retained from the messages. The predictions of the study were generally confirmed for the messages more familiar and acceptable to the subjects. Subjects also distorted the content of the message to fit more closely with their religious beliefs. These results support the study of religious material from a cognitive psychology perspective.
462;1985;Freshmen attending 8 colleges affiliated with the churches of Christ responded to questions about their religious behaviors, religious motivations, and premarital sexual behaviors. It is argued that a religious sample may be able to give us information about the relationship between religiosity and sexuality that more general samples could not. The religious and sexual characteristics of this conservative Christian sample are described, and are found to differ markedly from most samples studied in this area. In addition, a number of relationships are tested and discussed. The well-substantiated relationship between religious and sexual behavior is replicated, with some interesting points raised by the fact that this sample is more religiously active than any others reported to date. The relationship between religious orientation and premarital sexual activity is documented for the first time, and is found to be as strong a correlate as is religious behavior. Religious orientation and behavior are so highly related in this sample as to prove no more predictive of sexual activity when considered together than they do when taken separately. Finally, it is shown that, whereas the religious variables function to identify virginal adolescents with great accuracy (virgins are homogeneous in regard to religiosity), they do very poorly in identifying non-virginal adolescents (non-virgins are heterogeneous in regard to religiosity). It is suggested that there are third factor influences at work on non-virginal adolescents that have not (as yet) impacted virgins.
463;1985;Having examined the nature of conservative church growth in a highly industrialized setting, Canada, the authors turn to South America and explore evangelical expansion in Bolivia, Brazil, and Peru. Protestants in these developing countries are found to be growing primarily through proselytism, at the expense of the Roman Catholic Church. Nevertheless, as in Canada, the religious market in South America appears to be fairly tight. Moreover, the diversification of religious offerings on the part of Roman Catholics, notably the introduction of charismatic Catholicism, may well make inroads by evangelicals even more difficult in the future. It is concluded that conservative church growth by proselytism reflects a South America necessity, and that the prospect of the development of a self-sustaining evangelical pool similar to those found in Canada and the U.S. is somewhat dim.
464;1985;"Images of God data from the General Social Survey (1983) are subjected to factor analysis. Three images of God factors are identified: God as king, as healer, and as relational. Women score higher only on the God as healer image. The three images are positively interrelated and have substantial, positive relationships with church attendance. The finding that women score higher on God as healer, or a supportive factor, is viewed in part as related to succor women have traditionally received in church participation; the differences by gender in regard to holding this image of God are diminished when church attendance is controlled. The findings are compared with conclusions drawn by Vergote et al. and Roof and Roof. The claim that Americans are more likely to emphasize instrumental (God as king) rather than supportive (God as healer) images is challenged."
465;1985;In a continued effort to develop an instrument to measure religious involvement, the internal consistency approach to test development was used to analyze three data sets. Sample one consisted of members of the United Methodist Church who answered the 1968 Questionnaire (1968Q) developed by King and Hunt (1972b). The second and third samples were the subjects reported in two of the King and Hunt investigations (1972a, 1975). The findings of the factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis of the King and Hunt items provide strong support for the seven factors reported by Hilty, Morgan and Burns (1984). The results of the coefficient of congruence across samples found very acceptable estimates for the factors and items in the data sets. The meaning of the results and their implications for research are discussed.
466;1985;Past researchers showed that Christian religion has consequences in the realm of church social action and social issues only for persons with high religious salience. Using nationwide survey data on American Christians we replicated these analyses using 33 different measures of possible consequences. The results varied from value area to value area. Religious beliefs have direct impact on values in only a limited realm -- mostly the domains of family life, sexuality, and personal honesty: they have no direct impact on most political and economic attitudes. The specification model found in the past with regard to church social action was found only with regard to three political values, and only among better-educated persons. An opposite pattern was found on three consequences in the areas of ratings of church adequacy, traditional sexuality, and respect for authority. The consequences of religion vary greatly from value area to value area. Future research must be articulate about the specific values it is studying.
467;1985;"Previous research has shown that religion, especially intensity of involvement, is associated with attitudes toward possible reasons for abortion. Support for abortion in response to physical considerations (""hard"" reasons -- birth defect, threat to mother's health, rape) differs substantially from advocacy of social considerations (""soft"" reasons -- not wanting more children, not able to afford more children, not wanting to marry). Proposing a theory of value conflict, we suggest that physical and social reasons evoke conflicting values of self determination and responsibility for others. Since these values are differentially emphasized both by religious groups and by degrees of involvement with religion, the ""elective affinity"" between values and abortion reasons not only explains part of the empirical relationship between religion and abortion attitudes but also suggests an intervening mechanism by which religion influences decisions regarding abortion. We further inquire whether there is an interaction between religious involvement and value orientations, and whether the effects of these variables changed between 1974 and 1982. Using U.S. data from the National Opinion Research Center's General Social Surveys, we find that values do explain part of the relationship between religious involvement and abortion attitudes. Changes in the nature of the interaction between involvement and values are interpreted as evidence of increasing values crystalization over time."
468;1985;Sociological research has tended to neglect the meaning for respondents, particularly the elderly, of religious issues, beliefs, concepts, and practices. In this study, religious meanings were elicited, through open-ended and structured questions, from 40 elderly, female nursing-home residents. The open-ended responses, reported here, were subjected to computer contextual content analysis, and additional understanding was gained through the use of factor and cluster analyses. Two major ideas -- Cognition and Conduct -- were identified, and the subthemes contained in these categories were explored, using verbal examples from conversations. Responses were profiled along both ideas and then cross-classified in order to draw out dominant meaning patterns or orientations running through the responses. Four such themes were identified: 1) Choice within Ambiguity, 2) Normative Certainty, 3) Goodness and Trust, and 4) Normative Uncertainty. Classification in these categories was then compared to denominational membership, which suggested that the religious meaning orientations were related to but distinct from specific belief systems. The utility of these findings for understanding other social behaviors and attitudes is also explored.
469;1985;Status inconsistency and cultural explanations for attitudes toward New Christian Right social issues are assessed in a sample maximizing differences in denominational prestige among Protestants. The findings clearly support a cultural perspective and, it is suggested, are also consistent with a status enhancement interpretation.
470;1985;"The current proliferation of legal conflicts over ""church autonomy"" reflects the incompatibility of two contemporary tendencies: 1) the functional diversification of constitutionally protected religious organizations; and 2) the expanding regulatory mandate of the state to enforce public accountability of organizations for harmful or fraudulent practices. This paper examines several cases involving the financial practices of deviant movements, including the conviction of Sun Myung Moon for tax evasion and the intervention of the California Attorney General in the finances of the Worldwide Church of God. These cases have elicited widespread concern among mainline church leaders, who appear to interpret them as boundary-defining engagements whose outcomes will yield rules applicable to the legal status of churches in general. These cases illustrate the difficulties faced by churches in attempting to legitimate diversified structures of economic rationality in terms of (individual) freedom of religious conscience."
471;1985;"The founder of behaviorism, John B. Watson, grew up within a fundamentalist cultural milieu heavily influenced by the Protestant religious movement of dispensational millenarianism, a movement that began in the South and became widespread in the United States by the turn of the century. Watson's animal experiments for his doctoral dissertation at the University of Chicago reveal a dense structure of millenarian symbolism, the scenes of animals and apparatus depicting the rise of evil Babylon in the urban environment around Watson at the University of Chicago, an environment characterized by social disorganization, diverse peoples and alien religions. In constituting the psychological synthesis of behaviorism, Watson adopted the role of the Covenant God of dispensational millenarianism, ""promising"" and ""threatening"" his people according to precise numerological formulae, in order to accomplish social transformations of millenial proportions. Watson's anti-religious rhetoric functions chiefly as the millenarian prophet's diatribe, on the eve of the Apocalypse, against the corruption and degeneration of the ""established churches,"" particularly the urban religions of Catholicism and Judaism. Watson's various experiments and studies throughout his career are analyzed in detail for the rich fabric of millenarian symbolism they contain. The chronological sequence of Watson's studies are found to exactly parallel the temporal development of the various mythical prophesies used by the millenarians to predict and describe the Last Days before the coming of the millenium."
472;1985;The hypothesis that large-scale economic development and population redistribution has led to the demise of regional culture is examined for the traditional Catholic Cajun community in southwest Louisiana. Using census type data, comparisons of religious affiliation patterns between the Cajun region, Louisiana, the South, and the nation demonstrate a small shift towards regional convergence over the 1950-80 period. An analysis of the twenty-two parishes in the Cajun region provides some limited support for the convergence argument. The results are discussed in light of earlier work by Newman and Halvorson (1984) reported in this journal.
473;1985;The received view of anomie as normlessness is reviewed and found to be unsubstantied theoretically and problematic empirically. The classical meanings of anomia as sin are reviewed in the works of Lyonnet and Sabourin, Hertz, Guyau, Lalande and others. This classical notion of anomie is then traced through Durkheim's writings.
474;1985;"There has been very little social science research on the financing of social movements despite the obviously critical role economic resources play in movement survival and impact. This paper offers a major accounting of the economic structure of the Unificationist Movement. The primary resource generating and disbursing structures are described and the relationships among them analyzed. This analysis suggests that 1) the movement is a minor factor in the religious economy although relatively highly diversified; 2) the economic structure is consistent with the characteristics of a world transforming movement; and 3) the Unificationist Movement is most unusual in its creation of a corporate conglomerate to underwrite its theological agenda."
475;1985;This paper presents an attempt to clarify the distinction between religious commitment and the identity change process through which an individual becomes religiously committed. It is argued that conversion and commitment have often been incorrectly equated in the social science literature. The question is asked whether those who have converted to a particular religious perspective are more committed than those who have been brought up in that tradition. The latter are referred to as alternators. Using a sample drawn from among born-again Christians, it is demonstrated here that religious commitment can be seen to vary within, but not between groups of converts and alternators. Religious commitment, it is argued, is sustained by interaction with other believers after recruitment to the religious group has taken place.
476;1985;"Though Northern Ireland is one of the most deeply divided countries in the world, little research has been carried out on cross-cultural perceptions. In this study, an investigation was carried out into the way young people aged 12-16 years perceived those who belonged to ""the other side."" In 1981, a six-item Likert-type openness scale was devised and administered with Francis' Attitude to Religion scale to 2133 pupils. It was found that openness scores increased significantly with increasing age, while attitude to religion scores decreased significantly with increasing age. Roman Catholic pupils were more open than Protestants, and girls were more open than boys. When sex, age and religious affiliation were controlled for, there was found to be a positive relationship between attitude to religion and openness, young people most favorably disposed to religion being most open to the other religious tradition."
477;1986;477 freshmen attending 8 colleges affiliated with the churches of Christ responded to questions about their own religious and sexual behaviors, as well as those of their parents and two best friends. Four hypotheses, designed to test the relative influence of parents and peers on the behaviors of adolescents, were advanced in this paper. The religious behaviors of parents and peers were found to be related to both the religious and sexual behaviors of adolescents, although peer religiosity completely overshadows parental religiosity in this regard. This is particulary interesting in that peer religious behaviors (to the best of my knowledge) have not been looked at for potential influence on adolescents' sexual behaviors. Parent and peer sexual behaviors and expectations were also significantly related to adolescents' sexual behaviors, but again peers were the more influential reference group. So strong is peer influence in these data, it is argued that parents no longer constitute an effective reference group by the time adolescents reach college. This holds true for this sample in spite of their being highly religious, a finding that seems to contradict the notion that religiosity extends the influence of parents into the college years.
478;1986;A factorial model for televangelism was proposed in order to integrate uses and gratifications variables into an effects model. The model employed three hypothetical causes (religiousness, audience involvement, and televangelism gratifications) and two criteria (support of and contributions to televangelism). Results generally indicated that support for televangelism is primarily linked to the religiousness of its viewers and not to gratifications received from the programs, but that contributions to televangelism are linked to religiousness and gratifications received from the programs. Also, contributors perceive televangelism as a favorable substitute in some ways for the local church and these perceptions relate to financial contributions to televangelism. This finding challenges the consensus of some recent research which concludes that televangelism has little or no negative effect on participation in local congregations.
479;1986;"A number of works written in the Soviet Union in the post World War II era assert that I. P. Pavlov was an atheist and materialist. Pavlov's presumed anti-religious attitude is used as a weapon in the Soviet State's struggle against religion. Pavlov's own statements show that he was, indeed, an atheist. Nevertheless, Pavlov opposed the persecution of religion. According to his theory of higher nervous activity, religion is an instinct evoked by difficult environmental conditions in biologically ""weak"" individuals. Since instincts in Pavlov's theory are innate and permanent, it follows that the Soviet's anti-religious campaigns create a trying environmental condition which would evoke religious responses in ""weak"" individuals rather than eliminate religious behavior."
480;1986;"A series of five studies explored the meaning of the positive relationship between End religiosity and the Crowne-Marlowe Social Desirability Scale (SDS). Among the more noteworthy findings were the observations that 1) End religiosity was largely unrelated to measures conceptually associated with social desirability response sets; 2) neither End nor the SDS yielded any important evidence of a relationship with maladaptive psychological functioning; 3) students at a religious college were less socially anxious than students at a public state university, a result contradicting the idea that religious persons are especially sensitive to evaluation by others; and 4) a substantial number of SDS items appear confounded by a religious relevance dimension. Use of the SDS in statistical control procedures may therefore be inappropriate in studies examining religiosity; and as a consequence, attempts to link the End orientation with exaggerated social desirability concerns may need to proceed with caution."
481;1986;Among the various attempts to identify the social roots of antifeminism, two theories in particular are prominent. The first argues that for both men and women, anti-abortion and anti-ERA sentiments have disproportionate appeal among lower socioeconomic status, rural, and older constituencies. The second asserts that for women these sentiments are most common among those most vulnerable to and dependent upon men. Examination of studies of anti-abortion and anti-ERA opinion suggest that both theories are wrong: What distinguishes opponents of abortion and ERA from proponents is neither social position nor personal dependency but rootedness in religious networks. Degree of religious involvement determines availability to feminist or antifeminist mobilzation and shapes cultural beliefs about the conditions that empower women and ensure their security. Both of these, in turn, determine opinion on abortion and ERA.
482;1986;"Conceptualizations of God and commitment to God were assessed to determine their relationship to each other and to academic major, gender, and year in school. A 90-item Adjective Ratings of God Scale, adapted from Gorsuch's (1968) scale, and a brief questionnaire were administered to 543 students at a Christian liberal arts university. Adjective responses were combined to form nine subscales indicating different aspects of conceptualization of God. Commitment to God was significantly related to academic major, but was unrelated to gender or year in school. Conceptualizations of God were significantly related to commitment on eight of nine dimensions. Conceptualizations of ""God as Distant"" and ""God as Vindictive"" were significantly related to academic major. Conceptualizations of ""God as Irrelevant,"" ""God as Majestic,"" and ""God as Vindictive"" were significantly related to gender. Conceptualizations of God were unrelated to year in school. God concept scores were highly inter-correlated. Problems of measuring specific aspects of the conceptualization of God are discussed."
483;1986;Epidemiologists often correlate religious attendance with a variety of health outcomes and claim that religion represents a protective factor with respect to health. However, these analyses are typically zero-order (i.e., uncontrolled) and thus fail to address the possibility that partialling out the effects of potential explanatory variables might reduce such associations to insignificance. Using a three-generations sample of Mexican American Catholics, the authors regress subjective health onto religious attendance, alternatively controlling for four such variables: social support, physical capacity, social class, and subjective religiosity. Among both older and younger women, significant zero-order associations are explained away by removing the effects of physical capacity. These findings lend empirical support to theoretical work in social gerontology which suggests that religious attendance may represent a proxy for functional health, especially in older people.
484;1986;Glock's (1962) multidimensional conceptualization of religiosity assumes the existence of five dimensions: 1) Ideological, 2) Ritualistic, 3) Experiential, 4) Intellectual, and 5) Consequential. De Jong, Faulkner, and Warland (1976) used first- and second-order exploratory factor analysis to examine the Glock model. The purpose of this research was to use essentially the same statistical procedures with an adult sample to compare the similarities and dissimilarities with the De Jong et al.'s findings. The next step was to examine the De Jong et al. model with the confirmatory factor analysis procedure in LISREL VI for an adult and university student sample. While the De Jong et al. model was a significant improvement over the null model (i.e., worst model), the adult exploratory model, consisting of Belief, Experience, Individual Moral Consequences, Religious Knowledge, and Social Consequences, was found to have the highest degree-of-fit criterion statistic. The second-order analyses did not provide a clear answer to the dimensionality issue.
485;1986;Health-related situations pose a particular challenge to the need to find justice, meaning and control in life. This study points to the rich and varied ways that attributions to God are integrated into attempts to maintain meaningful views of the world and to cope with the world. A sample of 124 undergraduates was presented with four health-related situations depicting responsible or irresponsible behavior followed by a positive or negative outcome. They then responded to causal and coping attribution items. As predicted, attributions to God's will, God's love and God's anger were greater in noncontingent/unjust, positive outcome, and negative outcome situations respectively. Attributions to God's will appeared to represent a benign, external, alternative explanation to chance attributions. The results also support the view that people turn to God for help in coping more commonly as a source of support during stress than as a moral guide or as an antidote to an unjust world. Generally, these findings underscore the need for further integration of religious concepts into the general attribution and coping literatures.
486;1986;High fertility has been a distinctive feature of Mormonism for over a century. This paper takes a closer look at the determinants of Mormon fertility. Socioeconomic status does not necessarily have a negative impact on fertility, as is generally the case, implying that the effects of socioeconomic status may vary according to the religious context. Acceptance of the Mormon theology of marriage, contact with other Mormons as a reference group, and socialization in a Mormon subculture all have a positive influence on fertility. This pattern of high fertility strengthens interdependence between religion and family.
487;1986;"In a nationwide postal survey of 946 respondents, the viewers' ""uses and gratification"" of Swedish broadcasted Sunday morning worship services were studied. An hypothesis that watching TV worship services is less burdensome than, but functionally similar to, attending services in church and that, as a consequence, TV services will displace church attendance, was investigated. The results show that watching TV services is experienced as less burdensome than attending church and that watching TV services, for a majority of the viewers, provides the same amount of over-all gratification as attending church. However, watching TV worship services provides different kinds of gratification than attending church. Thus, watching TV services should not be regarded as functionally similar to attending services in church. Only for Ss with poorer individual and environmental possibilities for attending church, is watching TV worship services functionally similar to attending church. For other Ss, frequent TV service viewing is associated, above all, with non-religious experiences."
488;1986;"Methods of studying religion can be divided into those which help the investigator ""understand"" religion from the believer's standpoint and those which ""explain"" religion in the terms of the sciences. Yet despite the contemporary polemics, these methods need not be alienated from one another. Applying the hermeneutic theory of Paul Ricoeur we can see that the study of religion involves us in an act of interpretation which necessarily requires both methods of understanding and explanation. Ricoeur's theory is employed to show how these methods can be systematically used in tandem so that the most adequate interpretation of the religious world is produced."
489;1986;Most research on fundamentalist and evangelical Christians has used these labels interchangeably, despite differences between the two groups. This paper compares and contrasts the political attitudes and behaviors of the fundamentalists and evangelicals within the Ohio Moral Majority. The fundamentalists are consistently more conservative, and the difference is significant after controls for denomination and demographics. The fundamentalists are more likely than the evangelicals to perceive a strong connection between their religious and political beliefs. The strength of this connection is associated with domestic conservatism among the fundamentalists, and with domestic liberalism among the evangelicals. Evangelicals are more politically active and sophisticated, and are more likely to be active in other political groups. The study suggests the utility of differentiating between fundamentalists and evangelicals in future research.
490;1986;Quantitative studies of 19th Century American religion have long been frustrated by a lack of data on religious affiliation. In this essay we use census data on churches to reconstruct detailed membership estimates for 1850, 1860, and 1870 by means of weighted least squares equations. We then assess the validity of our membership estimates by comparing them to surviving statistics for several denominations and by demonstrating the sensitivity of our rates to historical nuances. The results are reassuring. This means that scholars now will have adequate data to chart the growth of the denominations and the general increase in church membership in the 19th Century -- not only for the nation, but broken down by regions and states.
491;1986;Recent applications of the local/cosmopolitan dichotomy to questions about the relationship of religiosity to attitudes toward minorities and controversial issues indicate that the local/cosmopolitan distinction constitutes an important intervening variable in multivariate models involving various prejudices, religiosity, and typical demographic variables. This paper continues this work by applying the model to church members' attitudes toward women in the ordained ministry. The study also refines the local/cosmopolitan dichotomy by distinguishing between structural, cultural, and ecclesiological localism, a set of conceptual differentiations clearly implicit in earlier work but not actually pursued systematically. Analysis of survey data indicates the utility of this refinement of local/cosmopolitan thought and raises questions about its previous applications.
492;1986;Rodney Stark and William S. Bainbridge have advanced a theory of religion which draws upon a wide range of supporting data. One body of data advances the claim that new religions will appear disproportionately often in settings where traditional religion is weak, and that -- contrary to prevailing opinion -- Europe is markedly more receptive to new religions than the United States. This paper subjects that claim to critical scrutiny and finds it entirely wanting. Through a reanalysis of the Stark and Bainbridge data, and with the addition of new data of a more persuasive kind, this paper demonstrates that the pattern which emerges is more complex than Stark and Bainbridge allow. While cult activity may increase with declining church attendance -- a finding compatible with their theory -- cult activity is seen to remain particularly high in Anglo-Saxon, Protestant dominated, immigrant based societies, despite continuing high rates of church attendance. An alternative theory is drawn from extant work to account for this finding and the overall pattern.
493;1986;"Studies have demonstrated that many Western schizophrenics suffer from a ruptured linear time conception reflected in their inability to relate their present to past and future. It is hypothesized that the futurist ""clean leaf"" rehabilitation model, according to which past failures are to be conceived as a ""closed book,"" is rooted in an unshakeable Oedipal ""original-sin"" conception, which perpetuates cognitive dissonance between past, present and future. Based on case studies taken from the Jewish Midrash, a rehabilitation perspective is presented according to which ""repenters"" may reinterpret and contract their failing past by identifying with Biblical role-models who sinned but were subsequently acquitted by the Midrash. The differentiation between the cognitive dissonance based hermetic conception of the past and the cognitive consonance oriented hermeneutic approach to the past, is intended to comprise the components for an intrapersonal model of dialogue in time in which the contracted ""I"" (past failure) may enter into dialogue with the expanding ""thou"" (future goals)."
494;1986;The Catholic base Christian communities (CEBs) of the poor in Brazil are widely interpreted as a force which is irreversibly transforming Brazilian society. But while much attention has been paid to the CEBs' potential role in defining the democratic and fraternal character of the 'new' society which is ostensibly emerging, few analyses have focused on the mechanics of the societal transformation process as it is concretely undertaken within the groups. Using data obtained in 1984 for a major study of CEB structure and orientation in the Archdiocese of São Paulo, this paper describes and critically analyzes the CEB's 'local improvement strategy', a principal means through which the groups instigate social change in Brazil. By pointing out the difficulties encountered by the CEBs in undertaking this strategy, the study demonstrates that the groups' revolutionary potential is subject to certain limitations which have largely been overlooked in the literature.
495;1986;"The experiences of Mennonites who move from rural communities to urban areas are not unlike those of other people who have had similar experiences. What is unique, however, are the conceptual adaptations which this sample of Mennonites have made. This paper reviews the major influences which have loosened individual commitments to Mennonite rural communities. It then examines the conceptual adaptations made by a sample of Mennonites living in one metropolitan area, as they attempt to maintain their identities. Key processes in their adaptations are the revised definitions of ""community"" and ""service."" Associated processes are the high degree of involvement in philanthropic projects and the use of psychological terminology which appears to bridge the gap between a heightened importance assumed by the self in an urban setting, and images of what it means to be a Mennonite."
496;1986;The study evaluates the effects of 5 years of religious training on the personalities of 31 residents of a Zen Buddhist monastic seminary. The Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory was administered to each subject each year. Comparison of results at Years 1 and 5 revealed predicted improvements, significant at the .05 level, in scales assessing ego strength and dependency and in two measures of general adjustment. A similar pattern of results was found across a time period of only one year in those subjects who experienced a major religious understanding. Comparison with similar studies conducted in Christian seminaries and religious orders suggests that specific elements of monastic life may influence personal adjustment.
497;1986;"This paper attempts to uncover the mytho-symbolic parallels between the social-psychological theories of noted sociologist W. I. Thomas and the vision of moral-religious transformation recorded in John Bunyan's ""The Pilgrim's Progress."" Thomas' emphasis on the ""definition of the situation,"" precise stages of moral development, and the four wishes are seen to be derived from Bunyan's themes of spiritual instruction along Christian's journey, his progress through various stages of sanctification, and the various spiritual polarities established by Bunyan as structuring principles of his text. Thomas is understood to have distorted Bunyan's vision of ultimate transcendence by equating salvation with adoption of the Protestant ethic and its institutional context of the American political and economic status quo."
498;1986;This paper examines the development of mourning customs from the early stages of the kibbutz, where the sacred in terms of Jewish tradition was rejected as a matter of ideology, and where secular tradition had not yet developed. Coinciding with the eradication of traditional symbols, there was a search for alternate symbols to replace those rejected by the revolutionary kibbutz pioneers. Hence, a process of creation and innovation of new rituals was introduced, either by the adoption of ritual elements from outside sources or by the transformation of existing Jewish symbols through the infusion of new content. These replaced the sacred transcendental symbols of traditional Jewish life with symbols which were to be no less sacred, but found their origins and definition in secular ideology and collective identity. As long as ideological fervor was strong, secular formulations of ritual could be preserved. With the waning if ideological fervor, some of the secular elements of mourning customs disappeared and more traditional content was reinstated.
499;1986;"This paper examines the hypothesis that adults without complete family ties (i.e., never-married, widowed, divorced, separated, or married but childless persons) resort to increased religious participation as a means of relieving anomie and gaining in church the comfort and companionship not available to them in their homes. This ""family surrogate"" theory of church involvement, put forward by Glock et al. (1967) in a study of urban parishioners of the Episcopal Church, has consistently been rejected in subsequent research. But many of these later studies are as suspect as the original one because of their limited samples and/or inappropriate methods of data analysis. Log-linear analyses of survey data from a nationally representative sample of Americans are reported in this paper. Contrary to the family surrogate theory, the results show unmarried church members to be less active than married members. In addition, having children seems neither to promote nor discourage the church involvement of parents. However, the results do at first appear to support the operation of the church as a family surrogate for persons who are not members of a congregation (a group to which the theory was not intended to apply). Lacking a spouse or a child elevates by about one-third the likelihood that a non-member will score ""high"" on a three-item index of church involvement. Yet, the analyses also reveal that this higher level of involvement is not associated in any way with feelings of anomie."
500;1986;This paper examins the financial activities, ideological foundations and goals of three new religious movements. The movements are: 3HO Foundation, Divine Light Mission and Vajradhatu. Research methods include participant observation, taped interviews, analysis of movement literature and examinations of group financial records. Results indicate that worldly success has become a religiously significant venture for at least two new religious movements. Within these groups there is a high degree of successful entrepeneurial and professional activity. There is also organizational and ideological support from the movements' leadership to the membership to become rich. Several interpretations are offered including historical precedent, sect-church transformation, institutionalization, a search for legitimacy and leadership influences. Resource mobilization is argued to be the most effective theoretical approach. Accordingly, movement direction is determined by rational leadership decisions in a practical attempt to realize projected goals and to promote group maintenance and survival.
501;1986;This paper is an application of Fullerton and Hunsberger's (1982) unidimensional scale of Christian Orthodoxy. Their research utilized Canadian and Australian samples, whereas ours made use of university students from the United States. Using factor analysis, including factor rotation in order to maximize meaning, our data showed two separate dimensions within the C.O. scale. These are conceptualized as a traditional form of church orthodoxy and as a rationalized form of modern religious orthodoxy. We also found a higher order factor of general orthodoxy. Three possible explanations are suggested for the differences noted between our results and those of Fullerton and Hunsberger.
502;1986;"This paper is an experiment in philosophical and cultural criticism that uses autobiography as a lens for viewing the changing ideological and institutional forms of religion in the modern West. ""The Confessions of St. Augustine"" furnishes the paradigm for this effort to use certain life experiences as ""parables"" both of the whole of a person's life and of an era's religion. This study traces the emergence of a ""fictive theism"" out of the Evangelical and Enlightenment traditions through an historical reading of Western culture as a move from myth to autobiography, an autobiographical reconstruction of personal experience as a move from belief to unbelief, and a philosophical critique of contemporary religiosity as a move from facts to fictions."
503;1986;"This paper reports the findings of a participant observation study of the role system of the Unification Church. After noting several strategic inconsistencies in the literature on roles and the organization of authority in the Church, the paper describes 1) the therapeutic ideology of ""heart"" elaborated by the Moonies; 2) the communal ideal they pursue, the personalized family; 3) the two fundamental role-sets of the Church: father and child, Abel and Cain; and 4) the organization of these roles in a therapeutic but hierarchical apparatus of charismatic relations. On the basis of its role system, the Church synthesizes the seemingly opposed social forms of personalism and authoritarianism in a distinctively therapeutic religion; it is an egalitarian gemeinschaft which organizationally integrates the ""impulsive focus"" of the contemporary narcissistic culture of emotions with its apparent opposite, the ""institutional focus"" of extreme religious fundamentalism."
504;1986;"Two studies were conducted to examine 1) the relationship between the three dimensions (quest, end, and means) of Batson's model of religiosity and level of moral judgment; and 2) the utility of Allport's religious orientations (intrinsic, extrinsic, indiscriminately proreligious, and indiscriminately antireligious) in predicting differences in level of moral judgment. Of Batson's three dimensions, only the quest orientation correlated significantly with moral judgment, while of Allport's orientations, the indiscriminately antireligious orientation had some utility for predicting differences among levels of moral judgment."
505;1987;Archaeological models and conceptual frameworks have been relatively successful in explaining the emergence of distinctively human types of behavior. This perspective can also be used to explain the development of the human species' religious nature and its penchant for ecstatic ritual experiences. Using an archaeological perspective, it is argued that the formation of inter-band alliances were critical for survival in times of severe resource stress. In turn, these alliances depended for their effectiveness on the establishment of very strong emotional bonds between members in different bands. Ecstatic states induced by ritualized procedures and shared by members of different bands are proposed as one of the key mechanisms by which strong emotional bonds were created and maintained between bands. Ecstatic states involve the subsuming of individual identities and priorities under unifying concepts, thus enabling bands to overcome natural tendencies to exclusivity in times of stress. Moreover, this reliance on ecstatic states leads directly to transcedent concepts typical of all religions. Ecstatic religion is therefore viewed as the essential core of early human religious experience and as having become widespread and enduring because it significantly enhanced chances of survival during periods of severe resource stress by maintaining alliance connections.
506;1987;As the discipline of psychology has become enormously diversified in this century, a great diversity of psychologies of religion has become possible and up to a point been demonstrated. Even more importantly, one can now see marked differences in the apparent motives and aims whereby psychologies of religion have been produced, with the result that partial, competing, and parochial views abound and a comprehensive psychology of religion is still a long way off. In this situation it is crucial to agree on criteria that guarantee perspectival integrity in the discipline of psychology of religion. Some basic guidelines are offered. In addition, some suggestions are made for needed new studies and approaches, including the developing of heuristically rich typologies, and a concentration on religion in aging persons and the dying, in some of whom dogmatic or ritualistic religiosity may have given way to a non-conflictual atheistic ethical and existential concern.
507;1987;"Coast Miwok Indian religion before the European conquest of California appears to have been bimodal. Its public face -- a world-renewal cult -- brought together peoples from surrounding regions in great celebrations. More privately, sorcery pitted neighbor against neighbor, village against village. This essay -- an exercise in historical reconstruction -- argues that the variable California environment let both aspects of this religion make sense, but at different times and to different degrees. The Coast Miwok environment was rich in resources, but each was subject to periodic failure. In most years there was enough food for all, and the common ceremonies were an expression of good fortune. In bad years, all sought common renewal. In some years, however, only certain lineages' resources might fail. Because all property was private, and there was no system of redistribution, sorcery ""explained"" (and provided retribution for) such inequities in fortune. In each situation, one or another aspect of native religion ""made sense."""
508;1987;"Despite the fact that praying the rosary has been one of the most popular of all Catholic devotions for centuries, there have been few if any social scientific investigations aimed at discovering the underlying appeal of this devotion. This article begins such an investigation by briefly reviewing the historical development of the rosary (as a prayer and as an associated set of beads). Freud's early remarks on religious devotions are then merged with his later arguments on neurotic obsessions and the anal personality in order to develop a psychoanalytic argument which explains the appeal of the rosary. The basic hypothesis presented here is that praying the rosary is appealing because it represents the disguised gratification of repressed anal-erotic desires. However strange the argument may at first seem, it does allow us to account for 1) the emphasis upon excessive repetition and orderliness found in the rosary; 2) the use of beads in praying the rosary; 3) the centuries-old tendency for the Catholic mind to associate the rosary with external threats to the Church; 4) the fact that the rosary first achieved widespread popularity in the German-speaking areas of Europe; and 5) the tendency to associate the rosary with flowers and flowery garlands."
509;1987;"Durkheim's assertion that Catholicism has a negative impact on suicide, often referred to as sociology's ""one law,"" has been seriously challenged in recent years. This paper re-examines the ""one law"" in relation to Durkheim's observation that the greatest potential for individuals to be integrated into society is found in urban areas. Using 3,108 United States counties categorized by degree of urbanization, the findings provide support for the ""one law"" and the integrative potential of urban areas. The data also suggest that sociological explanations are perhaps best suited to explain social life in urban rather than rural contexts."
510;1987;Empirical analyses of religiosity and self functioning may be complicated by an ideological conflict between certain humanistic and theistic value perspectives. Support for this possibility was supplied by the observations that inverse relationships were more obvious when explicitly humanistic self scales were employed and when beliefs about sin were expressed in an orthodox language emphasizing self rejection and guilt. Factor analysis revealed some humanistic values to be clearly antithetical to an orthodox commitment, and statistical controls for these values and for the guilt language of sin yielded overwhelmingly positive relationships between self functioning and forms of religiosity related to intrinsicness. These data suggest that future research progress requires attention to the ideological surround of the empirical question.
511;1987;"In an attempt to identify factors which predict frequency of drug usage by youth within a conservative denomination, a sample of 801 young people between the ages of 12 and 24 from seventyone churches in North America was chosen. The youth were questioned on the frequency of usage of ten drug categories as well as reasons for not using drugs, a variety of religious attitudes and behaviors, and educational and membership practices. As a reason for not using drugs, ""my commitment to Christ"" was the strongest predictor of abstinence from alcohol, tobacco, and all drugs combined. Other factors of nearly equal strength were ""I want to be in control of my life"" and ""concern for my health."" As to religious practices, regular participation in family worship was most highly related to abstinence over all categories with attendance at Sabbath School first for alcohol and personal prayer first for tobacco. Watching R-rated movies and listening to hard rock music (both strongly discouraged by the church) were both predictive of more frequent use, while intending to remain in the church and believing that God wants us to take care of our bodies were both associated with less frequency. While membership status of youth, mother, or father or years of parochial education had little effect on frequency of usage, joining the church at a younger age had a weak protective effect."
512;1987;In Centralia, Pennsylvania, a twenty-four-year-old underground coal mine fire has slowly destroyed the physical community, leaving in its wake much community conflict and suffering. And yet, unlike in most cases of natural disasters, local religious institutions and community residents failed to assign religious meaning to the problems associated with the fire. The paper argues that the failure of local religion to respond effectively is related to the chronic technical nature of the disaster agent. Unlike a tornado or hurricane, the mine fire struck slowly, lasted a long time, was caused by human beings, and required sophisticated technical apparatus to detect and abate. In addition, the patterns of victimization associated with the chronic technical disaster are different from those resulting from immediate impact natural disasters. These differences resulted in the acceptance of a technical, not moral or religious, definition of the problem. Implications of this for religion's response to other chronic technical disaster situations are discussed.
513;1987;In this exploration of moral theory and its relation to social theory, the construct of self-interest and its moral counterpart in self-sacrifice is analyzed. The argument is made that the self-interest/self-sacrifice perspective is tied to certain historical assumptions in liberalism which, in their individualism, limit our view of human nature, institutions, and social relations. The perspective of mutuality is proposed as one way to reconceive our understanding of social and moral relations and thus move beyond the incongruity between individualism and a social morality.
514;1987;In this paper deconversion from authoritarian religious movements is studied from the perspective of disaffection as it is expressed through the severing of socio-emotional bonds to the religious leader. Within this framework, a two-stage process of separation is elaborated in which bonds to the group are severed first, followed by the emotional disengagement from the charismatic leader. The bond between the leader and follower is shown to be most significant in determining the strength of continued commitment to the movement. An in-depth analysis of the leader-follower bond is offered, identifying specific sources of disillusionment. Principles of power dependency theory are then elaborated in order to explain the strength of commitment to the charismatic figure. Data for the study were collected through forty in-depth interviews of former religious devotees, representing seventeen different religious movements. Each of the respondents had left the movement voluntarily after an intense commitment to the group. The average length of religious involvement was four and one-half years and data were gathered on the process leading to conversion, the respondent's experience once inside the group, and the events which led to deconversion.
515;1987;In this study, the relationship between the religious activity of mothers and fathers and the religious activity of male and female adolescents was investigated. The gender of the adolescent was seen as an important variable. Two hundred and thirty five intact families with adolescents were drawn from the Olson, McCubbin, Barnes, Larsen, Muxen and Wilson (1983) data set of 1140 families. Findings indicated that only paternal religious activity variables were significantly related to female adolescent religious activity, while both maternal and paternal variables were significantly associated with the religious activity of male adolescents. However, even in relation to male religious activity, more paternal religious activity variables were significant than maternal religious activity variables.
516;1987;Judging the religiosity of individuals is difficult in itself, is often misleading, and is biblically condemned. Juding the religiosity of societies can be easier since in their aggregate, and in comparison with each other, a distinctive character of docility, of routine activities, and of effective social control can be discerned. Using crime rates as the main indicator, this article attempts to examine and explain the religiosity of the Saudi Arabian society since it claims a high level of benevolence due to the application of Shariah (divine) law. The methodology focused on the scrutinization of crime rates in the Kingdom and contrasted them with six Moslem adjacent countries in the region which do not apply Shariah law. The Saudi crime rate was dramatically lower than the median rate among the group, as well as considerably lower than in any individual country. Criminal data were further validated and interpreted by the use of three local self-reporting panels of judges, police officials, and laymen. Conclusions represent a synthesis of the unique role of Shariah law, the infrequency of criminal incidents, and ethnographic information collected from personal interviews conducted during a sabbatical leave the author spent in the Kingdom. The study shows that the continuing application of Shariah law in Saudi Arabia has a powerful cleansing influence on society, helps foster a non-criminogenic environment, and confirms some major theories in the literature in religiosity and socialization.
517;1987;"Martin Marty's model of division in American Protestantism proposed the existence of two ""parties"": a ""private"" one which focused on individual salvation and pietism, and a ""public"" one which emphasized social reform. Dean Hoge studied the condition of the two parties in the early 1970s with a series of theological indices. These have been replicated in a recent study of the laity of the Reformed Church in America. Findings suggest that, while the ""private"" party is vital in the RCA, the current form of ""public"" party appears to be a marginal one. In addition, a third, ""loyalist"" party, with a limited, institutional focus, has significant support. This group has a theology akin to that of the ""private"" party, but it holds a much stronger allegiance to the denomination, its traditions, and the congregations of the church."
518;1987;Meditation is approached as a technique for the activation of religious experience. Various theories used in psychology to explain the cognitive changes brought about by meditation are briefly reviewed. Of these, the role-theory of Sundén fits best the structure and function of various meditation methods in religious history. A small scale laboratory experiment is reported, designed for the purpose of testing the predictive validity of role-theory. The results make it possible to specify the theory's contribution and limitation.
519;1987;Mormonism's legitimacy is based on the claim that the church was instituted by divine mandate and by the authorization by God of Latter-day Saint ecclesiastical leaders, whose role as the only acceptable source of doctrine is stressed by church leaders and members alike. Mormons hold their religious beliefs to be based on continuing, literal revelation through the church President who is designated Prophet, Seer and Revelator. Doctrine is seen as flowing from the top of the church hierarchy to the grass-roots level. This study of the doctrinal beliefs of a sample of a Utah Latter-day Saints documents show, in spite of the authority-based concept of revealed doctrine, actual beliefs at the local level may deviate from doctrinal positions issued by church Presidents. In specific areas outside core doctrines of the church, the plurality or even majority of local members may espouse beliefs at odds with doctrines articulated by the Prophet of the church with no apparent awareness by members of their deviance from the official doctrine. The pattern of variation between Mormon official positions and folk-beliefs is outlined, and the processes that maintain this variation are discussed.
520;1987;Operationalizing religion in terms of both its official manifestations and an interrelated quasi-religious meaning system, the present study analyzes the impact of religion on the quality of life for adherents of one of society's alternative lifestyles, the Back-to-the-Land Movement. Data from a mailed questionnaire returned by 510 (66.2 percent response rate) are presented. Back-to-the-landers, often part-time and self-employed professionals practicing semi-subsistence agriculture on small parcels of land, have an elaborate worldview that justifies their counter-cultural lifestyle on the basis of ecological wholeness, simple living and self-reliance. Both simple correlations and multiple regression models are explored in order to assess the impact of official and unofficial religion, back-to-the-land behaviors and background factors on measures of quality of life. Generally, the measures of unofficial religion, termed quasi-religious meaning systems, are the strongest predictors of quality of life.
521;1987;"Researchers have recently reported that the established low correlation between intrinsic religiousness and prejudice is an artifact of social desirability. They found that only the quest orientation correlated negatively with prejudice. This study examined these developments in a culture in which prejudice against a certain group was not socially undesirable. One hundred and ninety-one Seventh-Day Adventists on the Caribbean island of St. Croix responded to religious orientation measures and a measure of prejudice against Rastafarians. We found that Adventist church members rated the church as more prejudiced than the general population on St. Croix. Strength of commitment to the Adventist church was significantly correlated with prejudice as was church attendance. Intrinsic religiosity was also significantly correlated with prejudice. There was no relationship between the extrinsic or quest orientations and prejudice. We conclude that there is no singular relationship between religious orientation and prejudice; researchers must take account of particular religious and social norms."
522;1987;"Snow and Machalek (1983; 1984) have pointed to the importance of language in understanding the conversion process. In particular, they have identified four ""rhetorical indicators"" characteristic of the accounts converts give about their conversion experience. After a brief review of these indicators, and of the Snow and Machalek approach more generally, we offer a critique and an alternative interpretation of the part played by language in the conversion process, and by the four indicators in particular. We substantiate our position both theoretically and empirically, with data gathered from a small sample of Christian evangelicals. We find, happily, that the four indicators characteristic of the Nichiren Shoshu believers studied by Snow and Machalek were to be found also among our Christians. However, only one of those four indicators, ""biographical reconstruction,"" was unique to the Christians who claimed a conversion experience, as such. The rest of the indicators were as common among lifelong Christians as among self-professed converts, indicating that they are probably indicators of religious commitment more generally, rather than of conversion per se. Of even greater theoretical significance, we believe, is our argument for understanding language and rhetorical devices as actively chosen tools and methods in converts' own efforts at self-transformation, rather than as indicators of what has already happened to them."
523;1987;"The central contention of opponents of new religious groups has been that adherents are subjected to coercive mind control. One important type of evidence marshalled to support this argument has been that former members of these groups show a distinctive psychological syndrome which is attributable to psychologically deleterious practices in ""cults."" One version of that syndrome is Conway and Siegelman's ""information disease."" Alternatively, a sociological role theory based explanation would suggest that the primary source of any emotional turbulence in former members of new religious groups would result from the dynamics of the exit process. Survey data on 154 members of controversial religious groups were used to explore these two alternative explanations. No relationship was found between Conway and Siegelman's predictors of information disease and the symptoms they identified. By contrast, a strong relationship was found between mode of exit and these symptoms. The data suggest, therefore, that the exit process rather than group experiences is the source of the kinds of emotional turbulence putatively labeled information disease."
524;1987;"The impact of religious debates about nuclear weapons on rank-and-file church members is tested through analysis of Lutheran Church in America survey data collected in a panel study. Sixteen items concerning nuclear weapons and defense were found to be multi-dimensional, forming policy, cognitive and ethical dimensions. Furthermore, relationships among these items were weak, and majorities were found on the liberal side of some issues but the conservative side of others, indicating that many respondents hold mixed and perhaps contradictory views in this domain. Demographic variables were found to be very weak predictors of the ethical dimension, and moderately weak predictors of the other two. Religious variables, on the other hand, were moderately weak predictors of the ethical dimension and almost unrelated to the other two. Conservative theological beliefs had almost no predictive value on any dimension, and higher levels of religious behavior and involvement had a weak tendency to predict liberal views on nuclear weapons. Regression analysis to determine the effects of religious and demographic variables considered together left these conclusions unchanged. Over the two-year before/after period of the panel, minor but consistent change in a liberal direction had occurred; approximately one-quarter of the respondents had become more liberal, while one-eighth had become more conservative. Analysis of the relationship between change and demographic and religious variables showed no relationship; change had been occurring in the same direction in almost all subgroups."
525;1987;The process of socio-economic achievement is elaborated through an analysis of data from eight NORC surveys, combined to create a sample of members of six religio-ethnic groups. Correlational analysis indicates findings similar to earlier studies. Using Methodists as the comparison group, Scheffe tests indicate that Jews differ in education, occupational achievement and income, Episcopalians in occupational prestige, and Baptists in education and income, but no significant differentials existed for Irish and Italian Catholics. Further analysis using decomposition suggests that traditional Jewish emphasis on education is an important factor in explaining these differences, but that the factors included in the model explain only a small part of the Baptist and Episcopalian differentials. It is suggested that religious values and religious perspectives are important considerations in understanding these findings.
526;1987;The purpose of this article is to describe the religio-psychological role theory presented by the Swedish scholar Hjalmar Sundén and to exemplify its application to personal documents, particularly in three cases: Ignatius Loyola (1491-1556), John Wesley (1703-1791) and the Swedish Mystic, Ruth Dahlén (1906-1976).
527;1987;"The relationship between religion and alcohol abuse, the relationship between alcohol abuse of parents and of children, and the subject of problem drinking in college are the focal points of an empirical investigation that explores intergenerational linkages between religiosity and problem drinking among collegiate youths. The results of this study indicate that students are at greater risk for problem drinking if they are: 1) from Gentile religious traditions as compared with Jews (as was the case with previous generations of students); 2) not strongly attached to a particular faith; or 3) the child of an alcohol abuser. In addition to presenting ""at risk"" categories for students, this study analyzes the intergenerational transmission of alcohol problems that can occur specifically through the influence of parental religion. In particular, the parental religion is related to these ""at risk"" categories, suggesting that characteristics of a parent's faith may have multiple paths of impact upon the young collegian's drinking experience. Parents' religious traditions and their degrees of religiosity largely determine the traditions and commitment of their children which, in turn, influence the student's drinking. Parental traditions and degrees of religiosity have also influenced parents' own drinking experiences as demonstrated here -- with Gentile parents and those with a weak faith experiencing greater alcohol problems -- which, in turn, have an additional effect upon the collegiate child's drinking as the children of alcohol abusers are more likely to become abusers themselves."
528;1987;This essay compares church-state relations in Russia immediately after the Bolshevik revolution to church-state relations following the Nicaraguan revolution. Although conflict between church and state is perhaps inevitable under revolutionary socialist regimes, tension was much greater in the Russian case. Variations in church-state relationships in the two societies can be traced to differences in religious institutions and to differences in the structure and programs of the revolutionary party. We conclude with some generalizations about church-state conflict in revolutionary socialist regimes.
529;1987;This paper describes an attempt to construct a typology of progressive Catholics using data obtained from a survey of the delegates to the 1980 National Pastoral Congress of English Catholics eighteen months after the Congress. Progressivism is regarded as the espousal of the new elements of religious ideology and pastoral emphases which have emerged since the Second Vatican Council. Following earlier attempts using smallest space analysis and factor analysis, this paper describes the use of cluster analysis to identify distinct groups of individuals and discriminant analysis to identify the separate dimensions which distinguish between the clusters. Seven clusters were identified in terms of six discriminant functions. An analysis of the social and religious characteristics of the seven types indicated that there was no simple unidimensional scale of progressivism. The paper concludes with some suggestions for a more comprehensive classification of progressive Catholics which might be explored in the case of other or more representative samples.
530;1987;This paper examines indiscriminate proreligiousness as a construct which holds important implications for the scientific study of religion. Approaches by researchers relevant to the construct are critically reviewed. As an alternative, our research team developed two scales directly measuring personal and congregational aspects of indiscriminate proreligiousness. The scales were refined using factor analytic methods and were empirically validated on samples of church members and church-going students. Both scales demonstrated evidence of content validity, internal consistency, construct validity, generalizability, and utility. A number of empirical and theoretical questions about the antecedents and consequents of indiscriminate proreligiousness are raised.
531;1987;This paper is a non-hostile outsider narrative describing the Rajneesh movement with special attention to their attempt to establish a spiritual center in Eastern Oregon. Analysis was complicated by the dispersed and mobile following exhibiting wide variation in commitment, linked communal groups, multiple corporate identities, and the movement's rejection of constraint to ideological consistency. Researchers of new religious movements may find the strategies employed useful when faced with these problems in other settings. The research experience reinforces cautions about the importance of the researcher's social location and relationship to the group being studied. The identity and demeanor of the observer influences what is available to be seen as well as how that may be interpreted.
532;1987;This study focuses on the political efforts of a random sample of Christian organizations involved in social protests in post Civil War America. It compares the outcomes of those challenges with those of a random sample of 41 nonreligious groups from a similar time period gathered by William Gamson for his study of social protest (1975). Following Gamson's approach, the organizational characteristics of the two samples are explored in an effort to explain differences in their success rates. Concerning the importance of religious identification on the group's abilities to promote successful challenges, it was found that the religious organizations are less likely to be successful than are the nonreligious groups. However, the analysis indicates that, during this period, religious identification was not directly responsible for the Christian groups' relative inability to reach their goals. Instead, their failure was linked with the Christian challengers' choice of multifaceted goals which were more difficult to obtain.
533;1987;This study tested the assumption that there is a direct correspondence between a clergyman's perception of his authority and the power strategies he uses to influence his congregation. Southern Baptist and Roman Catholic clergymen (N = 96) responded to a mail-survey. The results provided weak support for the assumption that clergymen use preferentially those strategies consistent with their basis of authority. The single incidence of a correspondence was between identifying with charismatic authority (i.e., being directly chosen by God) and using charismatic strategies, such as demonstrating that the gift of grace is within the clergyman. Identification with charismatic and traditional authority was associated with the greater use of strategies intended to influence the congregation. These results were discussed in terms of the existence of a hierarchy of authority bases, with authority which is perceived to be more closely associated with God being related to the use of more strategies to influence congregations.
534;1987;"Three hundred and seventy-one residents of ""Middletown"" were randomly selected and administered a questionnaire which included two items measuring rejection of AIDS victims. These two items asked the respondent if they thought children with AIDS should be allowed to attend school and if people with AIDS should be prohibited by law from jobs involving close contact with others. The only variable found to relate independently to rejection of AIDS victims was the perception that America had not recognized the contributions of Christian fundamentalists. This and other findings are discussed."
535;1987;With samples of college students, church members, and seminary students, the hypothesis that Batson's measure of quest faith would relate positively to conflict and anxiety was supported. Psychometric problems with the quest measure prompted construction of an alternate form with improved reliability. This resulted in associations with other variables more in line with Batson's original conceptualization. Problems still exist, but questions are raised regarding the meaning of conflict and anxiety in the context of social and religious deviance. Additional research directions are suggested.
536;1988;A sample of 124 female university students was administered measures of mystical experience, diabolical experience, absorption, hypnotizability and psychopathology. The mystical experience scale correlated significantly with measures of absorption and hypnotizability but failed to correlate significantly with indexes of psychopathology. However, the diabolical experiences scale correlated significantly with indexes of neuroticism and psychosomatic symptoms as well as with hypnotizability and absorption. Subjects who reported out-of-body experiences scored higher than those who did not on all measures of hypnotizability, but these groups failed to differ from one another on absorption, mystical or diabolical experiences, or on most indexes of psychopathology. Theoretical implications are discussed.
537;1988;Although there has been a good deal of attention to the supporters and activists of the New Christian Right, to date little attention has been paid to the behavior of the organizations of the New Christian Right. This paper uses data from the Federal Election Commission to assess the activities of Political Action Committees of the New Christian Right. Resource mobilization theory provides the theoretical focus of the investigation. New Christian Right PACs have raised large sums of money, but relatively little has found its way into the campaign coffers of candidates. The New Christian Right PACs, like those of the secular New Right, contribute primarily to Republicans, and give heavily to nonincumbents. Over the past few years, however, their contribution decisions have increasingly favored incumbents and have been targeted towards close contests, rather than lost causes.
538;1988;"Because general theories of secularization assume the disappearance of the church, its disappearance is also assumed as a factor in the creation and maintenance of people's identities. Even though the church persists, however, the role it plays in people's identities may nevertheless change with secularization. This paper explores how. It suggests that: 1) persons are differentially involved in both primary and secondary groups; 2) these involvements influence the meaning the church can have; and 3) thus influence the kind of religious identity available. A research project is proposed, and some tentative empirical support for these ideas is offered."
539;1988;Contemporary controversies over abortion, pornography, homosexual rights, family relations, and prayer in school pit traditional moral conservatives against modern liberal relativists. Prior analyses, especially status politics interpretations, are regularly biased by presuming liberal relativist attitudes and treating moral conservatism alone as warranting explanation. In fact, the spectrum of moral attitudes, from liberal relativist to conservative absolutist, is normally distributed in the urban research site reported on here. A causal model for the determinants of moral attitudes is proposed and tested with data from a city-wide survey in Raleigh, North Carolina, as a specific alternative to status politics explanations. Among the exogenous variables, age and education have significant effects throughout, while sex and race are significant only in the early stages of the model. Church membership and type, worship frequency, religious program listening, and political self-identification are endogenous variables which directly affect moral attitudes as well. The proposed model explains over 47% of the variation in moral attitudes.
540;1988;Data on 2,667 registered Catholic parishioners surveyed in the Notre Dame Study of Catholic Parish Life were used to assess the ability of devotional style, religious imagery, closeness to God, and agentic/communal religious identity to predict the influence of religious values on specific lifestyle and public policy questions and political ideology. Multiple regression analyses suggest that measures of imagery and devotional style are especially important predictors of the sociopolitical positions held by Catholics. In particular, images depicting God as judge are discussed, along with devotional styles that involve patterns of evangelical-style devotion, meeting minimal religious obligations, and exposure to media ministry. Findings are also compared to results obtained from other studies that have used similar variables as predictors of sociopolitical attitudes.
541;1988;Despite substantial evidence that participation in church decision-making events enhances member morale, satisfaction and commitment, there has been little systematic study of the communicative action that takes place during these episodes or the relationship between communication and desirable outcomes. This interpretive study proposes that characteristic cycles of communication negotiate tensions between 1) members' secular and spiritual identities, 2) dissonant elements of the group's ideology, 3) a Biblical frame of reference, and 4) inconsistencies between ideology and action in six Southern Baptist churches.
542;1988;Differences in work force participation by religious identity for time of interview and at age 16 (stable nones, apostates, converts, switchers, and stable religious) for men and women are investigated using General Social Survey data for 1973 through 1985 (N = about 14,900). The findings extend de Vaus's (1984) conclusion that work force participation carries quite different implications for church attendance among men and women. The present study finds the converse relationship, i.e., that religion bears differently on work force participation among men and women. In accord with Demerath (1961, 1965) and others' social class thesis, men without a religious identity (stable nones and apostates) are less involved in the work force than men with a religious identity. For women, however, this general pattern does not hold: Whereas among men, apostates show the lowest levels of work force participation, among women, apostates have the highest levels. This difference appears to be due to the disproportionate number of unmarried persons among apostates and the opposite effects of marriage on work force participation of men (positive relationship) and women (negative).
543;1988;Empirical analyses of religiosity and self functioning may be complicated by an ideological conflict between certain humanistic and theistic value perspectives. Support for this possibility was supplied by the observations that inverse relationships were more obvious when explicitly humanistic self scales were employed and when beliefs about sin were expressed in an orthodox language emphasizing self rejection and guilt. Factor analysis revealed some humanistic values to be clearly antithetical to an orthodox commitment, and statistical controls for these values and for the guilt language of sin yielded overwhelmingly positive relationships between self functioning and forms of religiosity related to intrinsicness. These data suggest that future research progress requires attention to the ideological surround of the empirical question.
544;1988;"Following the admonition of Peter Berger that members of the contemporary religious institution must periodically align themselves with prevailing social thought and practice, this case study analyzes the attempt of one group to reformulate the attitudes of its constituency on the subject of sexism. This study 1) reviews relevant literature on plausibility alignment; 2) argues that plausibility alignment is a rhetorical exercise; and using a systematic rhetorical analysis, 3) presents a case study of one major denomination's plausibility alignment exercise. The analysis reveals that in the throes of plausibility alignment, this group attempts to 1) identify and define the exigence; 2) address multiple audiences; and 3) ""sell"" an adjusted attitude toward sexism which balances the forces of accommodation and resistance."
545;1988;In an attempt to discover the effects of long-term membership in scientology, 48 members were administered a series of personality measures, including the Adjective Check List, the Purpose in Life Test, and the Barron Ego-Strength scale of the MMPI. Semantic differentials seeking responses on the respondent's situation prior to joining Scientology and demographic data were also administered. Results of correlations (partialled for age) between personality measures and time in the movement suggest that there was a significant increase in social ease and in effectiveness of goal-directed behavior. Data also indicated that members were unlikely to have been unhappy or unstable prior to joining. These findings suggest that the negative aspects reported by some authors of membership in Scientology are not apparent in this sample, and that there may be some benefits accrued to long-term members. Further longitudinal studies are required to confirm these data.
546;1988;In an effort to explore the cross-cultural applicability of the prejudice-religiosity construct (as defined in the United States research) within a Latin American context, we administered the Religious Orientation Scale (Allport & Ross, 1967), the Quest scale (Batson, 1976), and a culturally adapted social distance scale to a Venezuelan sample of 275 university students. The results indicated that, as predicted, the parents' nationality of the subjects was the highest predictor of prejudice (p < .05) regardless of its order of entry in the sequential multiple regression analysis. Extrinsic religiosity correlated positively with prejudice, Intrinsic religiosity correlated negatively, and Quest remained uncorrelated with prejudice. Implications for the cross-cultural applicability of these constructs in a Latin American context are discussed.
547;1988;In recent years considerable interest has been focused on the relationship between religiosity and psychological wellbeing. This article examines religiosity as a predictor of different components of wellbeing, in the context of several measures of meaning in life, with a sample of women. It is proposed that religiosity may show different relationships to the major wellbeing dimensions of life satisfaction, positive affect, and negative affect. The results demonstrate the religion-wellbeing relationship to be variable. The pattern of results was not consistent, with specific results finding direct (zero-order) and mediated, suppressed, or interactive (second-order) associations between religiosity and specific components of wellbeing, when life meaning was taken into account. The findings support earlier research in demonstrating that the religiosity-wellbeing relationship, where it does occur, is positive but small.
548;1988;In response to Conway and Siegelman's (1982) study of the purportedly deleterious effects of cult involvement, Kilbourne (1983) calculated rho and tau correlations among the variables in Conway and Siegelman's data and found little support for the conclusions drawn by them. In the present paper, Kilbourne's decision to use rank-order rather than product-moment correlations for this purpose is questioned. Results are then reported for a set of analyses parallel to Kilbourne's, in which Pearson product-moment correlations rather than rank-order statistics were calculated. The results provided substantially more support than did Kilbourne's analyses for the Conway-Siegelman claim that cult involvement may have harmful, long-term psychological effects on ex-members. Moreover, several relationships reported by Kilbourne, findings which led him to suggest that cult membership may actually have therapeutic effects, were not found to be significant in these analyses. The fundamental problem of addressing these issues using data aggregated to a group level is also discussed.
549;1988;In two studies of performance attribution of protestant ministers, motivational biases were demonstrated in ministers' explanations of positive and negative outcomes in both the spiritual and the instrumental-organizational domains of the ministry. Biases were demonstrated. Positive outcomes were attributed to variable and internal causes, while negative outcomes were attributed to stable and external causes. It is argued that this double bias might be understood as influenced by self-presentational concerns regarding the avoidance of theological hubris and public loss of face.
550;1988;Moral conservatism asserts traditional absolutes in lifestyle, personal relations, and sexuality. Many evaluations of moral conservatism's political influence focus on the New Christian Right. This study assesses moral conservatism among voters directly and its effects on presidential preferences in a causal model with data from a city-wide survey. Moral conservatism effects are significant and contributed to Reagan's victory. Although weaker than race effects, moral conservatism is at least as politically consequential as gender. Moral conservatism suppresses gender effects and mediates the political effects of age, education, and church membership. The influence of moral conservatism is greatest among older, less educated voters belonging to churches. Political implications are discussed.
551;1988;"Our aim is to adapt the theory of the demographic transition to the analysis of social change in religious organizations. Assuming the demographic transition of the clergy to be the driving force for pervasive structural change in the Roman Catholic church, we analyze the component processes of the transition as it unfolds over eight decades and document its consequences for changing the size and age distribution of the clergy population. The data are drawn from a nineteen-year census-registry constructed with the help of church officials in a diocese in the United States and one in Spain. Results show that the two dioceses lost almost 15 and 30 percent of their active priests, respectively, between 1966 and 1984. Projections based on the historical trends indicate that the losses could reach 45-65 percent by the turn of the century. In addition to the precipitous decline in numbers, the clergy is aging rapidly. The analysis describes the movement of a large, young and growing population of diocesan priests through theoretically predictable phases of transformation which include, midway, a stage depicting an old declining population and, eventually, a final stage with a pyramid reflecting a small, young and stable population. We conclude that the well-known structure of the societal demographic transition characterizes, ""mutatis mutandis"", the process of population transformation that takes place in organizations undergoing sustained membership decline."
552;1988;Prior studies examining the relationship among the variables of God control, personal control, religious involvement, and coping, have all used white samples. The purpose of the present study was to examine the validity of these relationships in a black Baptist sample (N = 98). Unlike most studies among white subjects, the measure of high God control correlated with high internal locus of control on Rotter's measure. Also, using stepwise regression analyses and removing the variance due to demographic and religious participation variables, internal locus of control but not God control predicted measures of coping skills and purpose in life. Both locus of control and God control predicted intrinsic religious motivation.
553;1988;"Psychodynamically, Augustine's conversion responds to and reconstitutes tensions and relational ambivalences generated by his experiences with the ""betraying embrace,"" principally as he has encountered its symbolic representation in his mother Monica's retentive and rejective tears, in one of her controlling dreams, and in his association with and loss of an unnamed friend. Those experiences crucially affect his own betrayals of secular covenants in his passage to conversion -- covenants with language and rhetoric, with order, and with ""lower instincts,"" among others -- and are themselves transformatively replicated in divine and divinely sanctioned alliances scrupulously structured by his emotional requirements to prevent betrayal: in particular, Augustine's ""Romantic"" relationship with deific embrace perpetuates in an altered mode the discontent that brought him to seek it."
554;1988;"Random samples of dormitory residents at three colleges in Xi'an, People's Republic of China, were polled regarding frequency of deja vu, night paralysis, extrasensory perception, communication with the dead, out-of-body experience, and belief in a ""sixth sense."" The Chinese students (N = 314) revealed incidence of these experiences, and faith in a ""sixth sense,"" equivalent to, or higher than those found in Western populations. Since Chinese students engage in no formal religious practices, this finding suggests that such experiences are not totally a product of religious faith, but are universal in some sense."
555;1988;"Recently writers have become concerned about the unsuitability of available models for the study of organizations which affirm values or involve strong commitments. Past preoccupation has been with Weber's rational bureaucracy. Bureaucracy needs to be complemented by alternative models which are general, neutrally descriptive and operational. Suggested complements are market, clan, and mission. Each (including bureaucracy) contains a sine qua non strength which, together in balance, produces greater survival power than when included only singly or in combination with only one or two others. The four models can also be used in historical sequence. American denominations, for example, have usually been conceived as missions, but selectively have become clanlike in isolation; or, under the impress of task management requirements have taken on elements of bureaucracy and/or market. In the recent past, pursuit of internal mission (evangelism) seems negatively correlated with external (social action). The problem of all organizations, including denominations, is to maximize balance among elements of all four types."
556;1988;Responses of 115 subjects to Hood's M-scale were subjected to principal axis factor analysis, for the purpose of verifying the factorial structure reported by Hood (1975). A two-factor solution, closely similar to Hood's two-component solution, yields factors interpretable as the Unitary and Interpretative categories of mystical experience. A three-factor solution splits the Interpretative category into Noetic and Religious types of interpretation. In both solutions, the factors are highly intercorrelated.
557;1988;Socially constructed time is an important aspect of both community and individual self understanding. Eschatology refers to the ultimate time frame. Within recent decades of nuclear buildup, the plausibility attached to Liberal versus Fundamentalist types of Christian eschatologies has undergone an historical shift from the former to the latter. Fundamentalist eschatology offers a social psychological context for the formation of meaningful identity and motivation with explicit reference to the nuclear context. This identity may be isomorphic with acceptance of the possibility of nuclear war by contrast with other eschatological identities. The hypothesis that different eschatological identities have affinities for different attitudes toward nuclear war needs further study with samples from the general population and especially people of power.
558;1988;Some social scientists have suspected that participation in radical movements satisfies human yearnings for transcendence just as does religious involvement. Accordingly, they have claimed that a pronounced though inverse relationship ought to exist between political extremism and commitment to traditional religion. Aggregate data support this position. Whole geographical regions such as the American West seem both to repel incursion by the institutional church and to spawn and nurture extreme politics. Others like the South sustain a conservative religious culture and seemingly drive away attempts at political innovation. This study evaluates the purported relationship between religion and politics in the historical context of the 1920's. Multiple regression analyses employing church membership totals by state are used to predict levels of activity in America's most radical labor movement of the period, the Industrial Workers of the World (I.W.W.). In turn, numbers of I.W.W. branches are compared with levels of church membership in those same states at a later date. The findings indicate that, even after controlling for population size, industrialization, and region of the country, religion and radical unionism exerted a negative effect on one another. States in which church membership was relatively high before the 1920's proved immune to the spread of labor radicalism, while places where the I.W.W. was already established had difficulty promoting church membership.
559;1988;Some treatments of religious development promote ideals more than they describe actual courses of personal religion. Criticizing two well-known theories, this paper offers a conceptual framework for investigating spiritual evolution scientifically. Based on developmental psychology, the theories in question place everyone, regardless of culture or personality, on a single evolutionary path. By contrast, I argue that the diversity and cultural relativity of personal spiritual striving calls for a pluralistic approach, one recognizing many forms of developed religion. Elaborating, I propose a culturally-neutral definition of religious development and an idiographic method and theoretical style. A case study of a rural black Pentecostal preacher illustrates.
560;1988;The Catholic Church has recently taken a greater role in encouraging and aiding political opposition to authoritarian regimes. The ability of the church to do this derives in part from its dominant cultural presence in these societies. It also derives from the unique character of authoritarian states. The need for legitimacy is common to these regimes. The quest often takes the form of appealing to religious legitimation. In return, the church is accorded privileges enjoyed by no other institution outside the state. This raises a paradoxical situation for the church: the less legitimate a regime, the more it needs the church. However, it is not in the church's interest to identify too closely with an unpopular and often repressive regime. There is also a second side to the paradox: the less legitimate the regime, the more the church may be disposed to oppose it for moral and evangelical reasons. If the church uses its freedoms in support of opposition movements, it may cultivate popular support, but it risks repression of its normal religious activities and loss of its freedoms, thereby jeopardizing its spiritual mission. This paper examines how this paradox is manifested in Latin America, Spain and Poland. Based on our observations, we offer several propositions concerning the circumstances, nature and intensity of church participation in anti-regime activity. Church resources, its organization and the level of social and political development of the country in question are the variables which are most strongly suggested as determining factors of the church's response.
561;1988;The modern versions of the English Bible were produced to update the language of the King James Version and make the content more comprehensible. It was found, however, that other variables were more consistently related to memory for the biblical text than was comprehensibility. Recall of subunits of narrative text was found to be clearly related to meaningfulness, interest, specificity, and concreteness. For expository material, meaningfulness and concreteness were most consistently related to recall of the biblical text. The importance of the text subunit to the structure of the passage in which it was found was related to whether or not the passage of poetic material would be remembered. Implications of these findings for translators, commentators, preachers, and teachers are suggested.
562;1988;The much-considered question of civil privatism in modern society has been discussed mostly in theoretical and normative terms. We identify one strand of this broader discussion that can be tested empirically. We consider declining participation in voluntary organizations, such as churches, as a manifestation of civil privatism, which has been alleged to increase as a result of the expanding functions of the bureaucratic welfare state. We also present counter-arguments that question whether there is a tendency for large state governments to promote civil privatism of this kind. We then test these opposing arguments with national data on voluntary membership in more than 200,000 local religious organizations collected in 1952 and again in 1981. The analysis, conducted at the state level, demonstrates a significant effect on membership of total government expenditure, controlling for urbanization, migration, and several other variables. We discuss the implications of these findings for the literature on state expansion and civil privatism.
563;1988;"The purpose of this paper was to examine a model consisting of three attitudinal and two belief constructs. The internal consistency approach was used to analyze the various versions of the original questionnaire designed to measure the five hypothesized constructs. Laymembers from the Mennonite, Presbyterian, and Roman Catholic denominations were the subjects in the first phase. Five common factors were found: 1) Religious Belief; 2) Religious Difficulty; 3) Social Conscience; 4) Religious Apathy and Boredom; and 5) Religious Satisfaction. In the next step, the instrument was administered to a nationwide sample and compared to previously developed religious involvement, religious orientation, and stylistic variance scales. A Second-order factor analysis found a two-factor solution to provide the best fit to the data. Denominational differences were examined among Mennonite, Presbyterian, and Roman Catholic samples with ANOVA."
564;1988;The purpose of this study is to determine if discordance theory is helpful in understanding the relationship between religiosity and alienation. Using a sample drawn from the general population in Memphis, Tennessee, hypotheses derived from the theory which implicate religious discordance (the perception that socio-cultural change is undermining religious ideals) as an intervening variable between orthodoxy and alienation were tested. Consistent with the theory, orthodoxy had a positive effect on alienation which was mediated through religious discordance. Unexpectedly, however, orthodoxy also had a negative direct effect on alienation which suggests that orthodoxy functions to integrate actors into society as well as alienate them from it. Implications of the findings for discordance theory and previous research are discussed, and an explanation is offered for orthodoxy's integrative influence.
565;1988;The relative importance of respect for human life and sexual conservatism as rationales for opposition to abortion is examined for three religious groups for the years 1977, 1982, and 1985. In general, Catholics, non-fundamentalist Protestants, and fundamentalist Protestants tend to oppose abortion because of respect for human life for the entire period. However, there exist in 1977 substantial differences in rationales for opposing elective abortion. In 1977, Catholics who oppose elective abortion tend to do so out of respect for life, while Protestants who oppose elective abortion tend to endorse a sexually conservative rationale. By 1985, all groups, except fundamentalists, oppose elective abortion due to considerations of sexual morality. For fundamentalists in 1985, considerations of life and sexual conservatism are of equal importance in explaining opposition to elective abortion.
566;1988;"This article brings recent developments in historical sociology and social history to bear on methodological approaches to the sociology of American religious history. In the past two decades, historians have taken sociologists to task for superimposing such concepts as ""modernization"" or ""civil religion"" on American religious history. At the same time, social historians have accused intellectual historians of ignoring the religious experience of ordinary people. In both instances, scholars have been urged to ground their interpretations in social experience. This conclusion suggests new possibilities and pitfalls for sociologists of religion working at the juncture of social theory and American history. By employing the data of social history, social theorists may be able to offer new interpretations of American religious history. Conversely, the use of such social information as church, census, and tax lists may permit some revision of social theory. These possibilities are countered by new risks, however, as sociologists become amateur historians. This essay probes the kinds of questions sociologists and historians of American religion have asked and the ways in which theoretical ideas and historical evidence have been brought to bear upon one another to answer these questions. It then considers strategies for creating an historically grounded sociology of American religious history."
567;1988;"This paper evaluates the impact of the explosion of research on new religious movements in the 1970's and 80's in the sociology of religion. The encounter with NRMs has been highly provocative in terms of an impetus to comparative analysis; a heightening of theoretical and epistemological ferment; the identification of interfaces between the sociology of religion and other areas of sociology such as social movements, deviance, social psychology, and medical sociology; the reconsideration of the secularization thesis and sect-church theory; and the reevaluation of the role of the sociologist of religion in terms of issues of objectivity and partisanship. The present heightened controversiality of religion renders its ""scientific study"" more precarious."
568;1988;"This study attempts to specify the sources of Catholic women's discontent with the church. Factor analysis produced three clusters of specific attitudes, centering on the church's response to 1) local issues; 2) moral issues; and 3) ideological issues. The main finding is that local issues are most important in determining women's general satisfaction with the direction of the church. In light of the Catholic bishops' decision to issue a pastoral letter on women in the church, the essay has some policy implications. Notwithstanding the importance of issues like abortion and the ordination of women, it is clear that the bishops must also address issues which in some circles of the intelligentsia may be considered mundane."
569;1988;This study examines the relationship between age and three aspects of religion: basis of belief, attitude toward religious experience, and frequency of religious practices, in a sample of 1027 Catholic diocesan priests in the United States. Older priests were found to be more certain of their belief and to base such belief more on logic and less on experience than younger priests. The younger the priest, the more he tended to experience God through people and events. Younger priests engaged in interpersonal religious practices more than older priests while older priests engaged in solitary religious practices more than younger priests. It is suggested that the effect of Vatican II must be taken into account in interpreting findings.
570;1988;This study reports on religious preferences and activity among Indochinese refugees resettled in Utah between 1975 and 1983. A significant group of these refugees adopted Western Christian religions, the majority affiliating with ethnic congregations. Reasons for change of religion emphasized interpersonal considerations and the need to re-establish social support networks. Refugees tended to rate religion as being important in their lives and reported a relatively high amount of religious participation. The major predictors of participation in religious activities were membership in a Western religion, ethnic origin, importance of religion prior to resettlement, and English-speaking ability on arrival in the United States.
571;1988;"This study tested the hypotheses that the attributional styles of Christian fundamentalists and of authoritarians are distinguished by their greater tendencies 1) to prefer dispositional explanations of others' behavior; and 2) to violate the normative attribution rules proposed by Kelley. A total of 165 psychology students who varied in their commitment to Christian fundamentalism and to authoritarian beliefs performed a series of attributional analyses of others' behavior. The results provided no evidence of a distinctive attributional style among Christian fundamentalists. Authoritarians committed more normative attribution errors, as expected. However, contrary to prediction, authoritarians were less inclined than nonauthoritarians to use dispositional explanations when such explanations were expected."
572;1988;Three styles of problem-solving were proposed, each involving a different reported relationship between the individual and God. Scales were developed to measure these problem-solving styles and were administered to 197 church members. These three styles were clearly identifiable through factor analysis. Further, as predicted, the three styles of problem-solving related differently to measures of religiousness and competence. The report of a problem-solving style involving active personal exchange with God (Collaborative) appears to be part of an internalized committed form of religion, one holding positive implications for the competence of the individual. A problem-solving style in which the individual waits for solutions from God (Deferring) seems to be part of an externally-oriented religion providing answers to questions the individual is less able to resolve. This style was associated with lower levels of competence. A Self-Directing style emphasizes the freedom God gives people to direct their own lives. This approach appears to be an active coping orientation which stresses personal agency, involves lower levels of traditional religious involvement, and is part of a generally effective style of functioning. This study points to the important diverse roles religion plays in the problem-solving process.
573;1988;"Tibetan refugees (Mahayana Buddhists, N = 59) and native Hindus (N = 66) residing in Himachal Pradesh in India were administered the Life Quality Scale. As expected, Tibetan refugees displayed greater life satisfaction than Hindu natives despite language problems and fewer financial resources for the Tibetan participants. Analyses of items across occupational levels revealed large differences between Hindu laborers and shopkeepers and relatively few between Tibetan laborers and shopkeepers. The high life quality reported by the Tibetan sample is interpreted in terms of their religious beliefs which stress self contentment and the pleasure of existing in the presence of the living God, the Dalai Lama. While both Hindus and Tibetans subscribe to the fatalistic attitude of Karma, the Tibetans report greater life satisfaction. If one looks beyond the superficial similarities in the concept of Karma, however, it becomes clear that Tibetans adopt a ""proactive"" posture as opposed to the ""reactive"" fatalism of the Hindus."
574;1988;To investigate possible changes in the factors influencing the decision to continue in the priesthood, a partial replication of Schoenherr and Greeley's 1970 study of American Catholic priests was conducted on a national probability sample of 729 diocesan priests. Overall, the results of the analysis are similar to the earlier research. The role commitment model based on social exchange theory is effective for explaining both data sets. The cost of celibacy as measured by desire to marry, although weaker than in 1970, remains the principal consideration in determining whether a priest will withdraw or continue in the active ministerial priesthood.
575;1988;Twenty years ago Johnson (1967) found that conservative Protestant clergy took less consistent stands than their liberal Protestant counterparts on a variety of political issues. Later research, however, suggests that members of conservative Protestant denominations may have become a politicized mass public. We approach this question by comparing conservative and liberal Protestants on their level of abstract political conceptualization and political belief system consistency. Using data from the 1972, 1980, and 1984 American National Election Studies, we find that conservative Protestants continue to show somewhat lower levels of political sophistication, attitude consistency, and consensus on issues. The results show that the conservative Protestant mass public remains less likely to link issues to the left/right political ideology in which political conflicts are framed and suggest a somewhat lower level of psychological involvement with politics among conservative Protestants.
576;1988;When studies of religion's effect on fertility seek to discriminate between nominal and committed followers, they often turn to measures of participation in church activities. Such an approach is conceptually defensible but empirically problematic with the typical cross-sectional data set, because the temporal ordering is wrong: such studies usually ascertain religious participation at the time of the interview, after the birth of children. I explore the problem empirically with data from the 1963 Glock-Stark Northern California Church Member Study. Finally, I discuss alternative indicators of religiosity for cross-sectional analysis, and the need for appropriate panel data.
577;1989;"A number of theories or models have emerged to explain the rise and pervasiveness of the ""option for the poor"" in Brazilian Catholicism. First, the ""institutional"" approach maintains that the ""option"" is primarily a product of elite initiative. A second perspective, posited largely by liberation theologians, insists that the ""option"" can be understood only as a ""grassroots"" phenomenon. Finally, a ""compromise"" approach borrows on elements of both the ""institutional"" and ""grassroots"" models. Proponents of this school argue that the Church's adoption of the cause of the poor is the result of an interplay between forces at both the base and the hierarchy of Brazilian Catholicism. Although the popularity of the latter two models has grown considerably in recent years, this paper argues that both the ""grassroots"" and ""compromise"" positions suffer from a number of deficiencies, most of which can be traced to a lack of solid empirical grounding. Furthermore, these more recent innovations appear to say little about where the Church and the ""option"" may be headed. The utility of the ""institutional approach"" in this regard is demonstrated by application of the model to current events on the Brazilian religious scene, events which reveal the ""option for the poor"" to be on the verge of serious decline."
578;1989;"Despite a number of interesting studies during the past decade, Guy Swanson's path-breaking work on the relation between religious belief and social structure in ""The Birth of the Gods"" has still not received the extensive analysis, replication, and critique which it deserves and requires and which would make further progress possible. This paper discusses one feature of Swanson's book not hitherto commented upon: the coding of societies during or after periods of profound social or cultural change. The problems which such coding can cause for interpretations of correlations drawn from large samples of societies are also discussed, using specifically the case of the Zulu from Swanson's chapter on the social correlates of monotheism."
579;1989;"Drawing on data from Poland and Spanish Catalonia, this article introduces the concept of a ""religio-oppositional subculture."" This is a concept that responds to two unanswered questions in current theories of opposition and resistance. First, why is the church so active in opposition movements against authoritarian regimes? Second, how is it that after decades of state repression, certain oppositions demonstrate startling continuity with themes of the past? A religio-oppositional subculture refers specifically to the merger of oppositional sentiments with religious symbolism, practice and organization. Also typical is a strong nationalist orientation. The primary locus of these subcultures is in the family, where primary socialization passes these values to new generations. Socialization in the subculture is continued in schools and secondary organizations run by the church. I feel that this concept can be advantageously applied to the emergent national oppositions to Russian domination and to the presence of the long-repressed national churches in those movements."
580;1989;"Earlier research has established that during the 1960s and 1970s, conservative Protestant denominations in general greatly increased in membership, while more liberal denominations declined. The major theoretical explanations for this trend have held that both cultural and demographic factors were involved. Of primary interest to researchers have been changes in the values of the youth counter-culture of the 1960s, including a decline in church participation. This exodus left mainline constituencies comparatively ""old,"" depriving them of the young adults whose children would have populated the churches through the 1970s and 1980s. The present study assesses the empirical evidence for various elements in this theoretical position, drawing upon data from the National Opinion Research Center's annual General Social Surveys of 1972 through 1985. This study establishes that attitudes toward personal freedom and morality, usually associated with the 1960s youth counterculture, are predictive of differential church participation, and that contemporary memberships of the liberal denominations have an older average age and a lower birthrate than those found in the conservative denominations."
581;1989;"Factor analyses of traditional and age-universal measures of intrinsic and extrinsic religion have identified two subcategories of extrinsicness, suggesting the original scales need revision. In this study, confirmatory multiple group factor analyses confirmed this suspicion, identifying extrinsic items concerned with social relationships (""Es"") and with personal benefits (""Ep""). The analyses resulted in a revised intrinsic scale which is now partially counterbalanced for acquiescence, an Es scale, an Ep scale, and three single items which may also be used for measuring these constructs. These scales, labeled I/E-R, have reliabilities equal to or better than those of the original scales."
582;1989;In an attempt to explain who is joining which church and why, research on religious participation has often focused on the individual. In this essay I use an ecological approach to look at the social context of religious adherence in 1850, 1890, 1926 and 1980. I argue that both mobility and composition of an area's population influences the church's ability to attract and retain members. Through use of census data, I demonstrate that migration, natural increase and sex ratio all affect an area's rate of church adherence. When applied to the historical development of America, these results help to explain why the frontiers have served as a home for religious experimentation and have attracted the missionary efforts of churches.
583;1989;"In this research, 98 introductory psychology textbooks from the 1980s were examined for religious content. The were then compared with 40 texts from the 1950s and 160 from the 1970s. A major increase in religious-related material was observed for the 1980s texts over those of the 1970s; however, both the number of citations and citation length were reduced in 1980s texts over those of previous decades, and these citations continued to be primarily of a non-research, discussion nature. Although evaluation of the religious material by text authors was largely unbiased, the main examples chosen often presented religion in a negative light. Additionally, research in the psychology of religion was rarely present, and references were frequently to popular writers and well-known books. Indirect evidence is present of either author bias against religion in introductory texts or failure to look beyond mainstream psychology."
584;1989;"In this research, age-period-cohort models were estimated for NORC church attendance data. The models were identified by assuming no life-course effects on church attendance beyond age 70, an assumption strongly supported by past theory and research. The results a) support a ""stability"" model of the relationship between aging and church attendance; b) strongly indicate the presence of secularization trends for both Protestants and Catholics; and c) demonstrate that there has been a revival in church attendance for Protestants in the early 1980s. The phenomenon of concurrent secularization and revival is discussed."
585;1989;In this research, principal component analyses of the Interactional Scale in nine separate samples revealed a reliable two-item Identity factor that was directly related to the Allport and Ross Intrinsic Scale, to other measures of an End religious orientation, and to generally adaptive self-functioning. A two-item Doubt component and two other items that failed to load reliably on any factor predicted greater extrinsicness, diminished intrinsicness, and a tendency to display psychological maladjustment. These data challenge previous attempts to identify an independent Quest form of commitment and suggest that the Interactional Scale may actually reflect an amalgamation of Means and End religiousness. The results may also present noteworthy difficulties for previous attempts to interpret linkages between Quest and behavior as revealing a pro-social religious orientation.
586;1989;In this research, we examined a small part of the substantial detailed data on church activity for colonial Woodbury, Connecticut. Time series regression analysis suggested that religious activity in Woodbury, as reflected in new church members and baptisms, was influenced by wars and economic activity but not influenced by particular ministers. Regional population trends influenced church activity as long as the church was established. Deviations from trend occurred because of periodic revivals. The Great Awakening, however, was a continuation of an underlying trend.
587;1989;"In this study, fundamentalism, extrinsic, intrinsic, and quest religious orientations were used to predict discriminatory attitudes toward blacks, women, homosexual persons, and communists. The four discriminations yielded a strong ""general tendency to discriminate"" factor, while residuals for each scale reflected unique discriminatory attitudes toward each group. As predicted, fundamentalism correlated positively with all discriminatory attitudes and with the general tendency but was negatively correlated with residual anti-black attitudes. Quest (especially with a revised scale) correlated negatively with all discriminatory attitudes, even with fundamentalism controlled, but predicted a general ""Don't discriminate!"" attitude rather than positive attitudes toward particular groups. Several sex differences emerged for extrinsic and intrinsic religion: Analyses with three extrinsic religion subscales found that social-extrinsic and personal-extrinsic religion predicted males' discrimination, while religious seriousness predicted females' discrimination. Also, intrinsic religion was positively related to discriminatory attitudes for females but not males, though these relationships vanished when fundamentalism was controlled."
588;1989;"Innovation theory is used in this study to understand the motivations of religious ""nones,"" or people who express no religious preference. Predictions about religious nones were derived from an analysis of data from the NORC General Social Surveys, 1973-1985. This analysis explores why some Americans have no religious preference and studies the conditions conducive to such innovation. Generally the results were as expected. Recommendations are made for improving the theoretical framework. Future research should consider why so many Americans who are seemingly alienated from religion retain religious identities and church affiliations."
589;1989;It has been proposed that adolescents are likely to change or maintain, expand or abandon their religious beliefs and practices because of pressure from parents or peers, because of cognitive development, or because of existential anxiety. This study proposes a social-cognitive model of change based on the concepts of anchoring and polarization. The sample consisted of 390 early, middle, and late adolescents who filled out a questionnaire assessing family demographics, religious background, beliefs, practices, and experience, existential questioning, and closeness to family and peers. Parents' religious affiliation and practices were positively related to all aspects of religiousness among early and middle adolescents, but only to practices and to decreased likelihood of change in the college-age group. Family closeness was also negatively associated with change. There was some evidence of peer influence on religious doubt and changes of faith. Existential concerns and SAT scores were positively related to change in older subjects only, but existential questioning seemed more likely to accompany change than to cause it.
590;1989;"Lynn White's thesis, that the disenchantment of nature in the first chapter of Genesis led to reduced concern for the environment in the West, has received little empirical research at the level of individual differences in religious experience. In this study, we separated the effects of four different measures of religious experience on four different indexes of concern for the environment. Results offered substantial support for White's thesis: (a) belief in the Bible, and only belief in the Bible, predicted scores on all four indexes of environmental concern and did so in the direction expected by White's thesis; (b) this occurred independently of the effects of background items; (c) standard regression showed the effects of belief in the Bible to be independent of those of other measures of religious involvement on two indexes, and on the other two indexes stepwise regression showed the same thing; and (d) in only two of twelve cases did any other measure of religious experience significantly predict an index score independently of belief in the Bible."
591;1989;Previous research has revealed a strong and persistent positive correlation between Protestant affiliation and the ownership of firearms. Utilizing data from the NORC General Social Survey, this paper proposes and tests two possible explanations -- one religious and one cultural -- for this relationship. The analysis lends primary support to the cultural model. In part, Protestants are more likely to own guns because, as a result of growing up in the rural South, they are more likely to hunt. Among non-hunters, the association between religious faith and gun ownership can be explained by the interaction of a frontier ethnic heritage with rural socialization and religious fundamentalism.
592;1989;Previous studies of support for the Moral Majority have relied on national samples or regional samples of all citizens. However, because the Moral Majority was formed to mobilize specifically evangelical and fundamentalist Christians, evangelicals constitute a more appropriate population in which to examine the sources of support. Using data from a national survey of evangelicals, I examined the demographic, religious and political sources of support for the Moral Majority. Even among this fairly homogenous population, religious variables played an important role, with orientation towards televangelists, the subjective connection between religion and politics, fundamentalist identification, fundamentalist doctrine, and anti-Catholicism all important predictors. Political variables were also important, with partisanship, attitudes on women's issues, and foreign policy attitudes emerging as significant in multivariate analysis.
593;1989;Prior research has consistently reported a reliable relationship between intrinsic religiosity (IR) and the Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale (SDS), a common measure of a socially desirable response tendency. However, it is unclear whether the relationship is produced by tendencies toward conscious impression management or unconscious self-deception. The present research was designed to disentangle the influence of impression management and self-deception inherently confounded in the SDS. We found that both tendencies toward impression management and self-deception are related to the leading measure of intrinsic religiosity. Implications for the measurement of intrinsic religiosity are discussed.
594;1989;"Processes of disaffiliation from Mormonism are explored in this analysis of in-depth interviews with 30 former Mormons identified in statewide mail surveys of Utah. Findings are organized into several existing typologies of conversion, dropping out, and apostasy. We emphasize the distinction between marginality and apostasy, and extend Brinkerhoff's and Burke's four categories to nine, to include the analysis of defection and apostasy among persons who otherwise would be classified as ""always apostate."" Most disaffiliates from Mormonism were always marginal members, and the metaphor of drift applies to their experiences. Among the minority of former fervent followers, factors associated with disaffiliation include family break-up, intellectual apostasy, and the ""push"" of unmet needs or exclusionary practices."
595;1989;"Questionnaire results from 762 attenders of five Baptist congregations suggest that the number and quality of friendships available within a congregation heavily influence attenders' church selection decisions. Ironically, the churches with the highest numbers of church friends per attender are either stable or declining. Newcomers find such churches ""cliquish"" because high-tenure members have as many friends as they want or can manage. The ability of church friendship networks to incorporate newcomers appears to decline as average tenure and number of church friends increase. In contrast, attenders of the two growing churches have lower attendance tenure, fewer church friends, and greater desire for additional church friends. They are thus more inclined to incorporate newcomers, which further facilitates their growth."
596;1989;Recent research has focused on the relationship between structurally based sources of organizational power such as opportunities for career mobility and independent decision making. This research, however, has rarely been applied to church organizations, and not at all to the situation of non-ordained workers in the Catholic Church. The present study applies the concept of structurally based organizational power to Roman Catholic nuns working in parish and diocesan positions, and compares them to the nuns who continue to work in more traditional education and health care institutions. Preliminary evidence is discovered to indicate that the respondents with fewer opportunities for career mobility and independent decision making are less satisfied with their jobs and more likely to anticipate leaving them in the near future. At the conclusion of the article, some tentative hypotheses are suggested for future research.
597;1989;Recent research into apostasy suggests that persons who have rejected a prior religious identity may be a diverse group. This paper explores this diversity by attempting to cluster apostates into well-defined groups. Five distinct clusters were identified using cluster analysis and were described through responses to criterion variables and to a set of additional questions which were not used to produce the cluster solution. Four of the clusters were composed of young persons with quite liberal social values, while a fifth cluster included older, settled persons who held conservative values on most social issues. However, this conservative group was the least likely of any apostate cluster to believe in an afterlife. All of the groups were named, and their descriptions give insights into the character of cluster members, the reasons for their apostasy, and the likelihood of a return to religion.
598;1989;"Schopenhauer's philosophy is not generally invoked in Durkheimian scholarship, especially concerning his sociology of religion. Yet, it appears that Schopenhauer's philosophy supplanted Comte's positivism in France at the turn of the century, and that Durkheim was enamored with Schopenhauer's philosophy. Using Schopenhauer's opposition between the ""will"" and the ""idea,"" this essay reevaluates Durkheim's argument in his ""Elementary Forms of the Religious Life"", focusing on Durkheim's pessimism, irrationalism, and metaphysics as refractions of Schopenhauer's philosophy. Implications are discussed briefly."
599;1989;The 1988 General Social Survey included a new measure providing information on the number of times people have switched religious preferences and why. Data show that one-third of all religious switchers are multiple switchers who tend to be male, well-educated, and concentrated in the Mountain region more than anywhere else. Marriage, family, and friends are the most-cited reasons given for switching.
600;1989;"The affinities between the ""New Christian Right"" and earlier mass-based moral reform movements have prompted scholars to revive the ""status politics"" model of right-wing protest. This model asserts that moral reform movements attract groups who resent their cultural, political and moral devaluation by the dominant society. The model has rarely been tested empirically and then only with very rough proxies for status discontent. In a survey of churchgoers in a Southern community, a direct measure of dissatisfaction with the social respect accorded traditionalist groups and institutions proved to be a significant factor in promoting support for the Christian Right. The contribution of status measures persisted even with controls for variables associated with rival explanatory frameworks. The findings suggest a future for the status politics model, provided its adherents heed several admonitions about conceptualization and measurement."
601;1989;"The contribution of spiritual support (perceived support from God) to well-being, especially under conditions of high versus low life stress, has received little empirical study. In the present research, the relationship of spiritual support to well-being for several high and low life-stress samples was examined. With demographic variables controlled, regression analyses indicated that spiritual support: 1) was inversely related to depression and positively related to self-esteem for high life-stress (recently bereaved) parents; and 2) in a prospective (longitudinal) analysis with pre-college depression controlled, spiritual support was positively related to personal-emotional adjustment to college for high life-stress (three or more life events), first-semester college freshmen. Spiritual support was not significantly related to well-being for low life-stress subsamples. The implications of the findings for future research and intervention are discussed."
602;1989;The role that religious experiences may play in the origin and growth of a religious movement has been largely ignored by social scientists. This study used a survey of 1,275 Assemblies of God adherents to explore the significance of Pentecostal religious experiences for the vitality of the denomination. The Assemblies of God, at present the twelfth largest Protestant denomination in the United States, has grown steadily during the twentieth century to its present record of 2.2 million adherents in the United States and more than 14 million abroad. Using survey data collected from 16 different congregations in six states, we tested the importance of Pentecostal experiences such as glossolalia, prophecy, being slain in the Spirit, and divine healing in accounting for the personal evangelistic efforts of members. We maintain that ecstatic religious experience is an important factor in evangelistic activities that undoubtedly promote church growth.
603;1989;"The survey of churches and church members sponsored by the National Council of Churches (NCC) is the most comprehensive and reliable data source of its kind. It is a very valuable tool in the study of the geographical distribution of denominations by counties in the USA. However, its major weakness is its failure to count the many ""independent"" congregations of the Baptist, the Holiness, and the Pentecostal churches. This study of 30 countries in middle Tennessee examines that weakness by comparing the NCC data with the Tax Assessors' records in these counties."
604;1989;The Virgin of Guadalupe is a well-known religious symbol honored throughout the Americas but especially in Mexico. This article focuses on the celebration of the feast of Guadalupe in a village in Sonora, Mexico. The region where the village is located has been developed agriculturally by the Mexican government and is now economically quite modern. The development program has had ethnic ramifications as well: where once two distinct ethnic groups existed there is now a cultural continuum. The Guadalupe fiesta in this case is a forum for the expression of a family's location on this continuum, and a means for socially validating changes in this status. The Guadalupe ceremonies also elicit ethnic allegiances in a community where ethnic cleavages exist but are rarely brought out. Through participating in specific ways in the various ritual dramas of the feast, individuals illustrate this cleavage and then overcome it by avowing the Virgin's protection of all Mexicans without regard to ethnic categories. This case has implications for the theoretical considerations of the relationship between economic change and ethnic identity, as well as for the role of individuals and symbolic expression in the context of social change.
605;1989;"This paper attempts to further empirical and conceptual understanding of collective forms of disengagement from new religious movements. I describe empirically the events and social forces giving rise to factionalism, group defection, and schism within the Los Angeles Hare Krishna community following the death of the movement's founder. I also describe the emergence, mobilization efforts, and ultimate failure of an incipient sectarian organization founded by dissident Hare Krishna members. Social psychological and structural approaches are analytically integrated to account for differing modes of collective disengagement and the fate of ""movements of exit"" (Hirschman, 1970). The paper concludes with a number of theoretical implications suggested by this ethnographic study."
606;1989;"This paper evaluates John Coleman's application of a particular version of secularization theory to Catholicism in the Netherlands. Recent research findings show that many changes in Dutch Catholicism in the last 15 years do not fit Coleman's model. The emerging pattern of radical secularization is linked to aspects of the preceding ""pillarized"" social structure and certain sociocultural changes facing the church. Instead of consolidation of a successfully differentiated denomination, evidence suggests, further cultural and structural attrition can be expected."
607;1989;This paper uses Goffman's notion of frame to examine the attempts by evangelical Christians to win converts through witnessing in public places. Such witnessing involves frame intrusion: an agent seeking to move a potential convert from one frame to another by introducing a new set of claims into an on-going situation. The techniques and problems of frame intrusion are discussed in the context of evangelical versus civil frames. More sensitivity to frame analysis is advocated.
608;1989;"This research tested a theoretical model of specific factors leading to support for Pat Robertson's presidential candidacy, using data from a survey of Middletown residents (N = 400). We found that Robertson's followers came from those who watched the ""700 Club"" television show, from those who were social traditionalists, from those who were political conservatives, and from those who were less well educated. However, Robertson received support only from a minority of these potential supporters. For the less well educated the immediate social environment played a greater role in support of Robertson; among those who were better educated, political and religious conservatism had a greater impact on political decisions. Resource Mobilization Theory proved inadequate as an explanation of Robertson's appeal. We suggest that his difficulties stemmed not from mistakes in strategy but from the incompatibility of Robertson's program with American culture."
609;1989;This study describes the development of a short (6-item) version of the 24-item Christian Orthodoxy scale (Fullerton & Hunsberger, 1982). Data from five studies, involving 1,725 participants, indicate that the Short Christian Orthodoxy (SCO) scale has strong psychometric properties which approach those of the longer original version of the scale. The SCO is apparently relatively unidimensional, with Cronbach's alpha of about .94, and inter-item correlations range from .69 to .74 across different samples. It is noted, however, that the SCO does sacrifice breadth of coverage of basic Christian tenets.
610;1989;This study investigated the relationship between rural church viability and shifts in the contextual and institutional subsystems, using multiple regression analysis. It was hypothesized that rural church viability would reflect the adaptation of the contextual and institutional subsystem to change, using a systems perspective. Viability was measured by changes in the number of churches and church attenders in the rural counties of a midwestern state. Indicators of the contextual subsystem included population change, residential composition and concentration, and per capita income. Three denominational categories, Catholic, mainline, and conservative Protestants represented the institutional subsystem. Data used in the analysis came from surveys of active denominations in North Dakota in 1971 and 1980. Census data for 1970 and 1980 were also used. Results indicated population change was the most consistent predictor of rural church viability. However, the strength of association and predictive power of other contextual indicators varied markedly depending on denominational category. Thus, support for our hypotheses was marginal, suggesting the need to re-evaluate the complexity of the church as a social system.
611;1989;"Using our reconstructed denominational statistics for 1776 and 1850, we demonstrate that the so-called Protestant ""mainline"" began to collapse rapidly, not in the past several decades as is widely supposed, but late in the 18th Century. Hence, by 1850 the Baptists and Methodists -- vigorous, evangelical sects in that era -- dominated the religious landscape. Treating the Congregationalists, Episcopalians, Presbyterians, Baptists and Methodists as ""firms"" competing within an unregulated religious economy, we seek to understand why the upstart sects won. The vital factors include organizational structures, the clergy, evangelical techniques and, perhaps most important, theology."
612;1989;Using tabulations from the 1971 and 1981 Canadian censuses, this paper examines religious group differences in the socioeconomic inequality of women and considers family behavior (fertility and marital stability) as a mediating factor in the generation of gender inequality. Secularization theory suggests that religious organizations are becoming less important determinants of socioeconomic and family outcomes. In this research, the role of religion is demonstrated by a substantial amount of variation across religious groups in the relative socioeconomic status of women and in family behaviors. Limited evidence for secularization is found by examining data from two censuses and trends across age groups, but the secularization process does not appear to be substantial. The data suggest that much of the variation in the relative socioeconomic status of women is due to differences in family behavior, and there is little evidence for the declining influence of religion in family behavior or in the socioeconomic inequality of women.
613;1990;A causal model was proposed in which the relationship between intrinsic religiousness and psychosocial competence is mediated by religious coping styles. The model asserts that the correlation between intrinsic religiousness and competence is suppressed due to differential mediation by collaborative and deferring religious coping styles. A covariance structure analysis using LISREL was utilized to test the model. A nested model comparison was conducted to assess the possible effects of two response bias variables: indiscriminate proreligiousness and social desirability. Multiple paper-and-pencil measures of all the variables except the response biases were included in a survey administered to church attenders chosen from the mailing list of two midwestern churches through a stratified, random sampling procedure. A total sample of 108 was obtained. The covariance structure analysis provided support for the validity of the measures. The nested model comparison failed to support the importance of response bias for explaining the relationships between the religiousness and competence variables. Substantial support was obtained for the inconsistent mediation hypothesis.
614;1990;"According to Roof (1978), the associations observed frequently between religiosity and social conservatism are primarily artifacts of localism. Lehman, however, has argued that localism should not be treated as a unidimensional construct and that an analysis of both social and cultural localism raises doubts about this interpretation. Likewise, Black (1985) has reasoned that ""breadth of perspective"" accounts for much of what Roof has attributed to locality identification. This research addressed these issues using data from a 1985 Dutch survey. The results tended to support Lehman's multidimensional assumption, with cultural localism being far more predictive of religiosity and conservative attitudes than was social localism. Parts of Roof's theory were replicated, but several aspects found no support. Possible explanations for the divergent findings are discussed."
615;1990;After a short history of growth, controversy, and intense friction with its environment, the Bhagwan Rajneesh commune near Antelope, Oregon experienced a series of events leading to the defection of part of its leadership, to the forced departure of the Bhagwan from the United States, and to the commune's collapse. This paper presents the results of a cross-national study of how the major print media in the United States, in West Germany, and in the Netherlands framed the events occurring in Rajneeshpuram. Similarities and discrepancies in the reporting styles of these three nations are discussed against a background of highly divergent societal responses to deviant new religious movements in each nation.
616;1990;"Although the Intrinsic-Extrinsic (I-E) framework has provided the dominant conceptual and measurement paradigm for the psychology of religion over the last two decades, research in this tradition suffers from a number of serious limitations. This paper details a variety of theoretical and methodological criticisms of contemporary I-E research, many of which have been noted by previous researchers but have yet to be adequately addressed. Theoretical problems include lack of conceptual clarity in the definitions of I and E; confusion regarding what I and E are supposed to measure (namely, intrinsic-extrinsic what?); the value-laden ""good-religion-versus-bad-religion"" distinction underlying the framework; the problems inherent in defining and studying religiousness independently of belief content; and the thorny issue of how I and E are conceptually interrelated (namely, Allport's original bipolar continuum versus the modern two-factor theory). Criticisms of the measurement of I and E concern the factorial structure, reliability, and construct validity of the I and E scales, as well as the empirical relationship between the scales. Although the I-E paradigm has clearly been successful in terms of generating research data, it is our view that much of this work is theoretically impoverished and has really taught us very little about the psychology of religion. Only a few years after the Allport-Ross I-E scales appeared on the scene, several researchers argued that it was time to move beyond a simplistic I-E framework to more theoretically and psychometrically sophisticated approaches. Nearly 20 years later, we believe this admonition bears repeating."
617;1990;Although there has been some controversy about the role of religion in the black community, this research found that religion was an important source of collective and political action among blacks in Washington, D.C. Those who frequently attended churches where pastors attempted to politicize their flock, and those who identified as pentecostals or who reported a pentecostal experience, were more supportive of collective action, reported higher rates of political participation, and showed more support for Jesse Jackson. These results suggest that the black church is a positive force in black political mobilization.
618;1990;As the Catholic Church continues to grow in membership size, its internal political economy suffers sustained loss of clergy manpower. Resignations from the priestly ranks is a major component of the decline. We present here demographic data from priest population registers, created from a random sample of 86 U.S. dioceses, which document high to moderate resignation rates from 1966 through 1984. Further descriptive analysis shows that a typical cohort of priests recruited about the time of the Second Vatican Council will lose 37% of its members through resignations within 25 years of ordination. In a regression model, using the diocese as the unit of analysis, we discovered that ecological and organizational conditions had a consistent influence on resignation rates in both 1970 and 1980. Based on the combined results of research to date, we conclude that a stable multi-level set of social forces has produced, and for some time will probably continue to produce, moderately high levels of voluntary attrition from the Catholic priesthood.
619;1990;Batson et al. (1989) recently reported two studies examining the association between the motivation to help and different ways of being religious. Their results indicated that intrinsic, end religion evoked egoistic motivation to gain social and self-rewards for being helpful, not altruistic motivation to relieve the victim's need. We used a Stroop procedure to provide a very different, further test of this relationship. After listening to a (bogus) radio broadcast that presented a young woman in need, 38 female undergraduates were invited to volunteer to help her. Before volunteering (or not), these subjects completed a Stroop task. This task used color-naming latency for goal-relevant words to assess the salience of three different goals of helping: receiving social and self-reward (e.g., praise), avoiding social and self-punishment (e.g., guilt), and relieving the victim's need. Helping by subjects high on intrinsic, end religion correlated positively with color-naming latency for reward-relevant words, indicating that seeking social and self-rewards was the goal of their helping. Evidence continues to mount that the prosocial motivation associated with intrinsic, end religion is directed toward the egoistic goal of gaining social and self-rewards.
620;1990;"Data on registered Catholic parishioners in the Notre Dame Study of Catholic Parish Life were used to test two theories that account for Catholics' exposure to religious television programming: the informational needs theory and the situational cross-pressures theory. Results from discriminant function analyses provided support for both hypotheses. The findings also indicated that younger, single Catholics who displayed low levels of involvement in institutional religion showed little interest in the ""electronic church."" Catholics who did watch religious TV, and particularly Protestant programs, tended to be younger converts from heavily Protestant regions of the U.S. These individuals appeared to find little religious fulfillment in traditional Catholic worship, but they did seem to find friendships and positive social contacts within their parishes."
621;1990;In recent years a number of sociologists have suggested that some conversions to new religious movements should be understood as active accomplishments and not as passive occurrences. The experience of some converts, it has been proposed, might be profitably treated as acts of creative role-play. This paper develops the notion of distinguishing between active and passive conversions by elaborating a role-theoretical approach to the study of conversions which is grounded in the theoretical identification of free and rational actions. Active conversions are demarcated through reference to the ideal limiting case of rational conversions, based on the principle that rational actions are their own explanation. Under the argument advanced for a broadened conception of rationality, a conversion is deemed more rational the more it is reflectively monitored. The notion of a reflectively monitored conversion is then recast as a reflexive role-enactment, entailing role-person merger, with awareness of the conditions of merger.
622;1990;In recent years, both the Moral Majority and the American Catholic Bishops have taken positions on diverse public issues, presenting these issues as coherent packages with single, underlying rationales. This study investigated the extent to which members of the mass public regard these issues as parts of more general gestalts. This was accomplished by examining the levels of constraint exhibited by members of different denominational groups. No religious group exhibited a high level of attitude consistency, but religiosity was related to attitude constraint among Evangelicals across a range of sex role and sexuality issues.
623;1990;"In this paper we argue that attachment theory, as developed by John Bowlby and refined and extended by a host of other psychological researchers, offers a potentially powerful theoretical framework for the psychology of religion. A wide range of research findings concerning such topics as images of God, conversion, and prayer can be conceptually integrated within this framework. An exploratory investigation was conducted of the relationship between individual differences in respondents' childhood attachments to their parents and their adult religious beliefs and involvement. A sample of 213 respondents to a newspaper survey on love completed a follow-up mail survey concerning their religious beliefs and family backgrounds. Multiple regression analyses revealed that certain aspects of adult religiosity, particularly beliefs about God and having a personal relationship with God, can be predicted from the interaction of childhood attachment classification and parental religiousness. Respondents who classified their childhood relationships with their mothers as avoidant (one of two insecure patterns of attachment) were more religious as adults, according to several measures, than were those classifying their childhood relationships as secure or anxious/ambivalent; however, this pattern held only when the parents were reported as having been relatively nonreligious. Respondents in the avoidant category also reported significantly higher rates of sudden religious conversions during both adolescence and adulthood, irrespective of parental religiosity. These results suggest that God and religion may function in a compensatory role for people with a history of avoidant attachment; that is, God may serve as a substitute attachment figure."
624;1990;"In this paper, I question Stark's and Bainbridge's (1985) characterization of the Bible Belt view of southern religion as a myth. The origins of the Bible Belt are examined in this paper. Using a conceptualization of the Bible Belt thesis based on a ""captive region"" view of religion, I expected clergy to be overrepresented in the South. Data on full-time clergy were analyzed by region during the 1890-1930 period. When urban/rural background was controlled, consistent evidence in support of the Bible Belt thesis appeared. The lack of clergy overrepresentation in the rural South may be explained by the importance of part-time clergy, which were not counted. In addition, the data offered no support for the application of the captive region view of religion to the black experience."
625;1990;In this research, 73 participants were categorized according to religious orientation (intrinsic, extrinsic, or indiscriminately pro) and were subjected to an isolation tank experience under one of two set conditions (religious or nonreligious). The experience was assessed by means of a modified mysticism scale with two factors: a minimal phenomenological experience factor (I) and a religious interpretation factor (II). As predicted, religious types did not differ on the report of minimal phenomenological properties of mysticism (factor I) as a function of set conditions. However, as predicted, indiscriminately pro participants had higher factor II scores (religious interpretation) under the religious set condition, while factor II scores were unaffected by set conditions for extrinsic and intrinsic types. Also, as anticipated, intrinsic types had higher factor II scores, while extrinsic had lower factor II scores regardless of set conditions.
626;1990;"In this study, 115 women and 91 men aged between 15 and 87 completed a questionnaire concerning religious beliefs, religious behavior, loneliness, neuroticism, and subjective well-being. The various dimensions of religiousness were related to loneliness in different ways. Whereas the concept of ""A Wrathful God"" was related positively to loneliness, a belief merely in the existence of God was independent of it. ""A Helpful God,"" on the other hand, showed a negative correlation with loneliness. The relation between religiousness and loneliness, however, was rather moderate in comparison to the relation between neuroticism and loneliness and subjective well-being. Likewise, the correlations between the religiousness measures and neuroticism were rather low. The importance of differentiating between various religious cognitions and various dimensions of loneliness is emphasized, and a possible way of helping the lonely is discussed."
627;1990;It has been suggested that highly religious persons may be more inclined than less religious persons to believe that the world is a just place and that innocent victims deserve their fates (Rubin and Peplau 1975). Evidence for this hypothesis is equivocal. For the present study, 252 participants completed a questionnaire which contained experimental manipulations designed to examine the relationship of one index of religiosity, Christian orthodoxy, to victim derogation. Highly orthodox Christians tended to derogate ill vignette characters (relative to a healthy vignette character) only when Christian beliefs were salient. In contrast, for individuals scoring below the median on a measure of Christian Orthodoxy, the salience of Christian beliefs attenuated derogation. It is suggested that either orthodox Christian beliefs or salient religiosity may attenuate victim derogation, but that both in combination may evoke victim derogation by making just world beliefs salient.
628;1990;"Many folk religions are deeply ingrained in Japanese daily life. Believers in such religions often rely on observances such as fortune-telling, prayer recitation, and incantation to protect them from accident and misfortune. The purposes of this research were: 1) to determine the dimensionality of religious beliefs in Japanese folk religion; 2) to clarify the relationship between religious beliefs and folk observances; and finally, 3) to compare religious behaviors of believers in folk religion with those of adherents of ""J?do Shinshu,""‡ which is regarded as one of the most intrinsically-oriented sects of Japanese Buddhism. A questionnaire was administered to 129 worshippers at the Ishikiri Shinto Shrine in Osaka. A principal axis factor analysis of the data, with varimax rotation, identified five dimensions of religiosity: ""Pro-religiousness, Belief in Soul, Belief in Guardianship, Ancestor Worship,"" and ""Modern Rationalism."" Partial correlational analysis revealed that two of these dimensions, ""Belief in Guardianship and Ancestor Worship,"" both essential components of Japanese folk religiosity, were closely correlated. These two beliefs were also moderately correlated with ""Pro-religiousness."" Among these five factors, ""Belief in Soul"" had a strong relationship to folk observances. Results confirmed that the religious behaviors of these worshippers were substantially more extrinsic than were those of ""J?do Shinshu"" members. These findings suggest that Japanese folk religious beliefs are quite multidimensional and therefore cannot be interpreted solely by the Allportian intrinsic vs. extrinsic dichotomy."
629;1990;Regression standardization has characteristically been used to examine mean differences, while approaches such as log-linear analysis have been more often employed when variables are dichotomous or do not satisfy interval-level assumptions. The typological regression standardization (TRS) procedure presented in this paper combines the analytical power of ordinary multiple regression with the typological advantages of contingency table analysis. It permits researchers to deal with multicollinearity among a limited number of predictors and can be used with both continuous and discrete dependent variables, if appropriate precautions are taken in the discrete case. TRS offers greater versatility in handling both predictor and dependent variables than do logit and probit specifications, and it has the further advantage of permitting more straight forward interpretation of results. Its disadvantages include the well-known problems connected with regression model specification, especially when the dependent variable is dichotomous. TRS may be especially useful, however, to researchers who are primarily interested in examining the relationship of one independent variable to a dependent variable while taking into account several potentially confounding factors.
630;1990;"Religion is a prevalent theme in the works of both Émile Durkheim and C. G. Jung, who participated in a common intellectual milieu. A comparison of Durkheim's ""collective consciousness"" and Jung's ""collective unconscious"" reveals strikingly similar concepts. The components of these structures, collective representations and archetypes, illustrate interdependent sociological and psychological processes in the theorized creation of religious phenomena. An analysis of the constitutive elements in these processes offers a basis for structuring a transpersonal sociology of religion."
631;1990;Rokeach (1960) has suggested that religious switching and intermarriage reflect a pattern in which choices are made on the basis of perceived similarity of denominations. This ordering (known as R-order) is: (1) Catholic, (2) Episcopalian, (3) Lutheran, (4) Presbyterian, (5) Methodist, and (6) Baptist. (Subsequent studies have placed sectarians in the seventh position.) In our research, data from the 1982-83 General Social Surveys showed that switching occurred most often among denominations which were one or two steps removed from each other in R-order. There was, however, a failure to discriminate between denominations more than two steps removed.
632;1990;The 1980s economic crisis within the Israeli kibbutz movement has spotlighted the outstanding economic performance of one element therein: the Religious Kibbutz Federation (RKF). This note compares the performance of the RKF with that of the secular kibbutzim between 1958 and 1982. The findings substantiate the theoretical perspectives of Max Weber and Werner Sombart regarding Judaism and economic success.
633;1990;The Basel Mission is a Pietist evangelical organization that was active in many areas of the colonial world in the nineteenth century. In addition to the intrinsic religious satisfaction it offered to all its members, the Mission provided its leaders with social honor and an arena in which to sustain useful long-term ties to others like themselves. For most of the rank and file, acceptance into the missionary life represented social ascendancy well beyond their modest material origins. I will explore how the prospect of this gain affected their decisions to participate and then go a step further by calibrating the extent to which they were able to pass on their newly acquired social advantages to their offspring. The discussion of the findings concentrates on the unintended secular consequences of such religiously motivated activities, and it speculates about the implications for the changing class structures of nineteenth-century Europe and the colonial world.
634;1990;The positive emotional function of religion has been well accepted, but the evidence has not been conclusive. Furthermore, research has rarely made explicit comparisons to persons who claim to have no religion. Using a representative sample of Illinois residents (and controlling for sociodemographics and willingness to express feelings), I found that the stronger a person's religious belief, the lower the level of psychological distress. This supports the idea that religion reduces demoralization and provides hope and meaning. However, I also found that persons with no religion likewise had low levels of distress. Thus, there was a curvilinear effect of religious belief on distress. In addition, I found that Protestants had the lowest distress levels, followed by Catholics, Jews, and others. Differences in belief systems, however, especially a belief in the American Protestant ethic, did not explain differences in distress among religious groups. Strength of religious beliefs appears to be more important than content in explaining the effect of religion on psychological distress.
635;1990;The social sciences of religion could be transformed by taking seriously the fact that humans are embodied. A new conceptualization of a mindful body has the potential to lead to profound shifts in how we view our subjects and their worlds. Our research strategies need to take into account that believers (and nonbelievers) are not merely disembodied spirits, but that they experience a material world in and through their bodies. Greater awareness of the social and political uses of human bodies should guide our research and theory.
636;1990;The specific aims of this research were: (1) to review past studies on the Korean ethnic church in the U.S., (2) to analyze the religious participation patterns of Korean immigrants in light of various theories on the immigrant church, and (3) to explore theoretical and practical implications of the findings from historical, comparative, and structural perspectives. The empirical data for this study derived from interviews with 622 Korean immigrants (20 years and older) residing in the Chicago area. In general, regardless of length of residence, sex, age, education, economic status, or sociocultural assimilation, church participation was found to be a way of life among Korean immigrants in the U.S. Data analyses generally confirmed the meaning, belonging, comfort, and mental-health theories but lent no support to the assimilation/mobility theory. In addition, historical and structural factors accounting for the Korean immigrants' pervasive participation in their ethnic church were explored, such as the Christian legacy of Korean immigration, the urban middle-class background of recent Korean immigrants, and their adaptation as a racial/ethnic minority in the United States.
637;1990;"There has been very little empirical research about prayer. No convincing psychological theory exists, nor does agreement about definitions or basic concepts. In our research, open-ended questions were used to determine the meaning of prayer for modern youth. A computerized procedure (TexTable) was used to analyze the answers. The results showed that the common prayer of youth can be summarized in one sentence, composed of seven structural elements: ""Because of some reason (1. need) I address myself (2. action) to someone or something (3. direction) at a particular moment (4. time), at a particular place (5. place), in a particular way (6. method) to achieve something (7. effect)."" These seven structural elements and their individual contents (totalling 45 categories) were analyzed for praying frequency and denomination. The correlations among the structural elements pointed to rather weak connections of needs, actions, and effects. This finding could be clarified by applying Clifford Geertz's (1966) constructionist definition of religion to a definition of prayer. Praying was described by the respondents as a coping strategy, mostly used to make things acceptable as they are (e.g., death and suffering), but sometimes also as a motivational device or an anticipatory action to change things according to one's wishes."
638;1990;"This analysis extended previous work on the relation between religiosity and anomia by: 1) assessing the effects of two different dimensions of religiosity; 2) checking for the possibility that the relation varies depending upon other personal characteristics; and 3) examining the relation in two time periods of the subjects' lives. The correlation of church attendance to anomia was negative but slight. Adherence to traditional religious beliefs was positively and significantly associated with personal anomia. The relations between religiosity and anomia did not differ significantly across time nor by gender, income, education, or residence."
639;1990;This paper builds on previous research suggesting that church membership influences community crime rates. Past studies have shown church membership and crime to be inversely related, but these analyses have been restricted to urban areas. Furthermore, the research on church membership and crime has not considered the effects of denominational type on crime rates. Church membership has been treated unidimensionally despite a Weberian tradition which holds that the theological nuances of the various Christian religions have profoundly different effects on some aspects of human behavior. With controls for a number of important demographic variables, this research found that church membership is negatively associated with crime. However, the data also revealed that this inverse relationship is associated more with Protestantism than with Catholicism.
640;1990;This research note examines 40 national Dutch surveys conducted since 1960 and finds that the percentage of nonmembers in surveys using a two-step-question indicator of church membership was markedly higher compared with that found in surveys employing a one-step-question indicator. The study also reveals that the differences in the percentage of nonmembers between the two indicators increased from the 1960s to the present.
641;1990;This study reports on a long-term research project of the former, and controversial, Rajneeshpuram commune. This project (the only systematic empirical study of the group ever undertaken) began in 1982 and continued until the commune's demise in late 1985. The relationship between the individual member's psychological processes and the commune's belief system was examined through the assessment of member's self-concept. The Public, Private, and Social Anxiety sub-scales of the Self-Consciousness Scale and the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale were administered to 230 commune members, who scored significantly higher than the general population in self-esteem. Subjects also scored high on the Private Self-Consciousness Scale, but low on the Social Anxiety and Public Self-Consciousness Scales. The score in Private Self-Consciousness accords with the movement's belief that self-exploration is a legitimate and respectable avocation, but it contradicts the stereotypical notion that members of new religions or cults are easily persuaded.
642;1990;This study uses the economic concepts of household production and human capital to develop and test a new model of religious participation. The model explains observed patterns in denominational mobility, religious intermarriage, conversion ages, the relationships between church attendance and contributions, and the influence of upbringing and interfaith marriage on levels of religious participation.
643;1990;"Unlike previous research on religion and political preference, this study utilized county-level data to analyze whether religious affiliation and church membership help explain why some communities have abandoned the Democratic for the Republican Party. We hypothesized that religion, independent of socioeconomic, demographic, and party identification forces, exerts an independent effect on average Republican voting in general elections for three races: presidential, senatorial, and gubernatorial. In particular, due to the changing nature of issues addressed in federal races (for president and senator), we expected that counties with higher levels of conservative Protestant members would experience ""realignment"" in the federal races between the 1950s and 1980s, while those communities with higher proportions of Roman Catholics would not. Through the use of multiple regression techniques, we found that conservative Protestantism in the 1980s, in contrast to the past, was positively associated with Republican electoral strength across all three races, even when controlling for other traditional explanatory factors. For counties with higher levels of Roman Catholics, we found that religion exerted an independent influence, but only for selected races."
644;1990;Using a sample of 423 single men and women, we studied the frequency of sexual intercourse. It was predicted that to understand the conflicting findings about the effects of church attendance on young people's sexual behavior, other variables need to be considered. Accordingly, a five-way analysis of variance design, with independent variables of church attendance, sexual permissiveness, age, state, and gender, was used to study the dependent variables of sexual behavior. The only variable with a significant main effect was sexual permissiveness, not church attendance. However, there was a significant two-way interaction between church attendance and permissiveness and between permissiveness and gender. The means for permissive and nonpermissive females were similar, but for males the nonpermissive subjects had dramatically lower intercourse frequency. The interaction between church attendance and permissiveness resulted because nonpermissive males and females who attended church had the lowest frequency, but permissive subjects who attended church every week had one of the highest frequencies of sexual intercourse. The results are discussed in the context of other research on the relationship between church attendance and sexual behavior. We concluded that lower rates of sexual activity for this age group occur when there is a high level of church attendance but also a low level of sexual permissiveness.
645;1990;Using data from a national Dutch survey, this research examined the influence of Christian belief on both ethnic prejudice and nationalism for the total sample of respondents, for the subset of nonmembers, and for three different groups of church members. The findings indicated that Christian belief had no effect on ethnic prejudice independent of localism and authoritarianism for the entire sample, for nonmembers, or for marginal and modal church members, but it did have a negative effect on ethnic prejudice for core church members. Furthermore, Christian belief had a significant positive effect on nationalism for the sample as a whole and for marginal and modal church members, but it had no independent effect on nationalism for nonmembers or for core church members. Possible explanations for these results are discussed.
646;1990;Using the Mental Health Inventory and the Comrey Personality Scales, we evaluated mental health and personality differences arising from differences in acculturation into the Hare Krishna movement for 132 males and 94 females with up to 18 years of membership and a mean time of 8.6 years. Subjects were volunteers from eight U.S. sites and averaged 30 years old. The degree of acculturation, a measure of religiosity, was defined by a specially developed scale and ranged widely across the sample. Personality traits were mostly invariant with acculturation, and those traits on which the Hare Krishnas differed from the norm group may be prerequisite to membership rather than being its consequences. Mental health was also largely invariable with acculturation, except that greater degrees of acculturation were associated with greater subjective well-being. Alternatives were explored to the hypothesis that increased religiosity benefits mental health.
647;1991;"A reply to Kirkpatrick's and Hood's (1990) critique of the intrinsic-extrinsic (I-E) framework is presented here. While areas of agreement exist, significant differences between their positions and those of this author are emphasized. These include differences regarding the nature and importance of Allport's theoretical precision and measurement problems with I-E (particularly the indiscriminately proreligious category); the importance and development of theories; the heuristic value of I-E; the role of values in religious research; the intertwined nature of religious and personality variables; and the problems of distinguishing ""rich"" from ""impoverished"" theories. While Kirkpatrick and Hood have pointed the way for progress, they are too radical in their proposals and fail to give I-E its proper regard."
648;1991;"Although the secularization theories put forward in the 1960s and 70s by different sociologists are not compatible at the theoretical level, they nevertheless share a very broad set of assumptions and analytical categories. This paper provides a systematization of this common framework (or paradigm). It is shown, with exact references to the texts of Luckmann, Berger, Wilson, Martin, Fenn, Parsons, and Bellah, that the secularization paradigm is based on a core of three ""concepts"" (or exemplars): differentiation, rationalization, and worldliness. Around this core are a number of logically subordinated exemplars, most notably autonomization, privatization, generalization, pluralization, and collapse of the world view."
649;1991;Based on his examination of 17th-century English Puritanism and 18th-century German Pietism, Merton concluded in his Protestantism-science thesis that ascetic Protestantism provided great impetus to the development of science. His evaluation of German Pietism as also supportive of science, however, largely rests on a static comparison of its religious ethos with that of English Puritanism. This study, based on original sources, challenges Merton's Pietism-science hypothesis via a historical examination that explores the changes in the European perception of science during the 17th and 18th centuries and, more broadly, the different institutional challenges that confronted the Puritan and Pietist movements. The study reveals that, despite their similarity of values, these movements responded in strikingly different fashion to the challenge of science due to variations in time, place, and attendant sociocultural realities. Considering the importance of the Pietism-science hypothesis to Merton's more inclusive ascetic Protestantism-science thesis, the discounting of the former may well call into question the validity of the latter.
650;1991;"Clinical observations suggesting a relationship between spiritual experiences, life purpose and satisfaction, and improvements in physical health led to the development of an Index of Core Spiritual Experience (INSPIRIT). Data from 83 medical outpatients showed the INSPIRIT to have a strong degree of internal reliability and concurrent validity. Multiple regression analyses showed the INSPIRIT to be associated with: (1) increased life purpose and satisfaction, a health-promoting attitude; and (2) decreased frequency of medical symptoms."
651;1991;Criminological and sociological theory have long assumed a negative relationship between religion and criminality, especially in secularized contexts and when the religious norms differ from the norms of secular society. The 1981 European Values Systems Study data for Sweden, which covered secularization and moral values among the churched and unchurched, suggest a negative structural relationship between the religious factor, on the one hand, and the rates for violent crimes and crimes related to the abuse of alcohol, on the other hand. However, no structural relationships were expected for property crimes, moral offenses, or drug-related crimes. Multiple regression analyses of ecological criminal statistics, church statistics, and census data for 118 Swedish police districts showed a differentiated structural religion-crime relationship, well compatible with the assumed pattern.
652;1991;Data from the 1979 and 1983 interviews of the National Longitudinal Surveys of Youth (NLSY) were used and logistic regression was employed to model the effects of religious affiliation contrasts along with control variables on the dichotomous dependent variable Premarital Sex. For both white females and males, a heritage of Institutionalized Sect membership (primarily Pentecostals, Mormons, and Jehovah's Witnesses) produced the lowest likelihoods of premarital sex. In certain models for the female and male samples, Fundamentalists and Baptists also displayed lower probabilities of premarital sex, compared to the contrast group of Mainline Protestants. These differences generally held up, especially the lower probabilities for the Institutionalized Sect category, even with controls for church attendance and a number of other control variables.
653;1991;"For some time, it has been demonstrated that women are more religious than men. Researchers have rarely questioned the validity of this finding. Rather than taking for granted the gender difference, the present study investigated the extent to which one of its underpinnings, a ""feminine"" gender orientation, accounted for variations in religiousness. The data from a sample of 358 undergraduates indicated that religiousness is influenced more by a ""feminine"" outlook than by being female. More exploratory analyses also revealed that men's gender orientation predicted religiousness more reliably than did women's. The findings suggest that the visibility of some men's religiousness might have been masked until now by a failure to look beneath men's status for variations within gender."
654;1991;"In an earlier paper published in this journal, Chaves (1989) found that the relative stability in Protestant church attendance in the United States results from the offsetting effects of secularization and revival. The secularization occurs across birth-cohorts, as successive cohorts are less inclined to attend church than were their forebears. The revival is a within-cohort phenomenon: Within birth-cohorts, attendance has increased over time. However, Chaves did not estimate the magnitude of the offsetting effects. For 1972-1989, cohort and period variation accounts for less than 1% of the variation in Protestant church attendance. Apparently cohort membership has little effect on church attendance, recent popular and scholarly accounts notwithstanding. Moreover, offsetting within- and across-cohort trends could reflect lifecycle effects rather than counteracting period ""revival"" and cohort ""secularization"" effects. We suggest -- consistent with Hout and Greeley (1987) and Greeley (1989) -- that the lifecycle interpretation is more plausible."
655;1991;In this paper we examine masculine and feminine aspects of religion as reflecting system needs. Our theoretical approach is based on Durkheim's insight that religion reflects society's collective consciousness, coupled with the Parsonian conception of system theory. We propose that masculine and feminine elements are expressions of instrumental and expressive system needs. Scanning briefly the histories of Judaism, Catholicism, and Protestantism, we have attempted to show that there is a correspondence between the gender-roles of deities and the conditions in which these religions have arisen. We have also sought to show that when the socioeconomic conditions of community adherents change, corresponding changes in descriptions of God also occur.
656;1991;In this paper, concerns are addressed regarding the reliability of the Quest scale introduced by Batson (1976) and Batson and Ventis (1982). After briefly reviewing the evidence, we have concluded that, although the Batson and Ventis (1982) six-item Quest scale seems to have acceptable test-retest reliability, it has poor internal consistency. To remedy this problem, a new 12-item version of the Quest scale is herein proposed. This 12-item version has satisfactory internal consistency (Cronbach's alphas in the .75 to .82 range) and, equally important, is highly correlated with the original six-item Quest scale (correlations in the .85 to .90 range). We recommend that both the new 12-item scale and the six-item version be used in future substantive research that seeks to assess the way in which a quest dimension of religion facilitates or inhibits personal adjustment and positive social behavior.
657;1991;In this paper, concerns are addressed regarding the validity of the Quest scale introduced by Batson (1976) and Batson and Ventis (1982). Some have wondered whether this scale might be more a measure of agnosticism, of anti-orthodoxy, of sophomoric religious doubt, or of religious conflict, if indeed, it is a measure of anything religious at all. We have reviewed the available evidence regarding validity, much of which has appeared in unpublished research reports, theses, dissertations, or convention papers, and thus has not been widely available. Based on the evidence, we have concluded that the Quest scale does indeed measure a dimension of personal religion very much like the one it was designed to measure: an open-ended, active approach to existential questions that resists clearcut, pat answers. Concerns regarding the reliability of the Quest scale, which have proved more persistent, are addressed in a companion paper.
658;1991;In this paper, the Multivariate Belief-Motivation Theory of Religiousness is presented. This theory integrates the religious domains of motivation, belief, and problem-solving style within one framework for the prediction of psychological adjustment. Religious problem-solving style is incorporated in a mediating role. Motivation, belief, and problem-solving style are operationalized respectively in terms of intrinsic/extrinsic religiousness, concept of God, and religious coping style. Trait anxiety is used as the criterion variable. The theory was evaluated for 161 students attending four Christian Protestant colleges. The results supported the necessity of differentiating religiousness into both motivation and belief in order to predict and understand religious coping style and anxiety. Religious problem-solving style mediated the relationship between belief and anxiety. However, both motivation and problem-solving style contributed unique portions of the variance in anxiety, which suggested that motivation was not entirely mediated by problem-solving style.
659;1991;"In this study, ""breakout churches"" (churches which have grown rapidly after years on statistical plateaus) were compared to churches which have remained on the plateau. Multiple discriminant analysis was employed to determine which factors were most useful in predicting ""breakout growth."" A set of 11 variables correctly classified 95.7% of the churches in the study. Many of the key items tapped characteristics which predisposed churches to breakout growth but were relatively difficult to engineer or plan. The most valuable programmatic variables included evangelism and goal-orientation."
660;1991;In this study, the Religious Problem-solving Scale (Pargament et al. 1988) was administered to 121 college students to investigate the relationship of three coping styles to self-reported guilt. Results indicated that the self-directing style (when a person relies on his/her own resources to solve life's problems) correlated negatively with the Mosher Sex Guilt, Hostility Guilt, and Morality-Conscience Guilt Scales, with the McConahay and Hough Guilt-oriented Scales, and with the Sin-Grace Scale. Both the collaborative style (when a person works with God) and the deferring style (when a person submits to God) showed significant positive correlations with the measures of guilt as well as with measures of religious interest and participation.
661;1991;"Most humanists and some social scientists are skeptical of a truly scientific study of human behavior, especially religious behavior. Competent scholars have raised questions which deserve serious consideration. Their main points relate to human freedom of choice and self-consciousness, to the importance of covert behaviors, and to a Biblical ""image of man"" that conflicts with that required by science. It is argued here that many scholars are misled by an outdated, mechanistic, deterministic view of science. In contrast, post-Heisenberg philosophy of science gives us a perspective complementary to that of theology. Review of scientific ontology and epistemology from Karl Pearson to Stephen Hawking leads to the conclusion that twentieth-century scientific method is suitable for the study of human behavior, including religious behavior."
662;1991;"Multiple regression analyses of data from a survey of 281 adults with varied religious orientations (mostly Christians, but including Unitarians, Jews, agnostics, atheists, and others) demonstrated that belief in aspects of ""Armageddon Theology"" is strongly associated with certain political attitudes; believing that Russia will be attacked by the U.S. before the year 2010; believing in one's ability to survive a nuclear war; and willingness to use nuclear weapons and risk nuclear war."
663;1991;Previous research on the impact of religiosity on suicide has been largely restricted to American samples. The present study explored the relationship in a fundamentally different socio-economic context: Sweden. With Sweden's welfare capitalism, the effect of religion might be minimal or nonexistent. A time series analysis finds that religious trends were unrelated to the general male and female rate of suicide, but were related to youth suicide rates. However, changes in religion were too closely related to changes in divorce to ascertain whether religious change or a more general trend toward social individualism was responsible for increases in youth suicide. Additionally, unemployment was unrelated to suicide. The models explained up to 80% of the variance in suicide.
664;1991;Prior research on the relationship between religion and/or religiosity and nonmarital sexuality (i.e., premarital, extramarital, and homosexual relations) has found an inverse relationship with enough consistency to qualify as an empirical generalization. However, while parsimonious, such a generalization is overly simplistic. Moreover, the research findings on which this generalization is based were biased by specification errors due to the employment of a theoretically inappropriate functional form. In this paper, we propose models, derived from reference group theory, which stress an interactive influence of both religion and religiosity on sexual attitudes, rather than the simple bivariate linear effects common in earlier studies. These models were assessed with data from the NORC General Social Surveys. Our findings, obtained from logistic regression analyses, support our theoretical models: The effects of religiosity on nonmarital sexuality vary predictably by religious affiliation.
665;1991;The effect of religion on health status was examined with a national sample of noninstitutionalized adults. Particular attention was given to assessing the effects of religious affiliation and religiosity -- especially practice -- on subjective health status. Respondents of all ages with a more conservative religious affiliation manifested poorer health than did those with a more liberal affiliation. However, higher levels of religious practice were positively associated with better health, regardless of age. The results show that religion may have both positive and negative effects on health, although in this research the positive effect was stronger.
666;1991;The question of individual stability versus change in values, attitudes, and beliefs has been much debated, as has the question of the relative importance of cohort effects, age effects, and period effects in the processes of such change. Thus, the issue of individual stability or change in religious beliefs, practice, and attitudes, dealt with in this article, is part of a more general problem. The present study builds on hitherto unpublished Swedish panel data from nationwide surveys undertaken in 1955 and 1970. The results indicate that the decline in adherence to traditional religious beliefs that took place in Sweden during the period studied was due both to a successive decline in religious beliefs from older birth cohorts to younger, probably connected with differences in religious socialization, and to a decline in religious beliefs within given birth cohorts, a decline most pronounced in the younger age strata.
667;1991;There has been an underlying assumption in much of the research on the Roman Catholic Church in Brazil that activism toward social and religious change is stimulated by the church hierarchy. That assumption is called into question by the present research which examined five dioceses in the northern state of Maranhão. Evidence is presented here to show that, even in dioceses where the bishop is not supportive of innovation, priests, sisters, and lay church workers are organizing base ecclesial communities (CEBs) that help to facilitate the empowerment of poor people. This article also questions the urban bias of much of the research on Brazilian CEBs, the majority of which are located in rural areas, and suggests that further studies need to be conducted in rural base communities in different parts of Latin America.
668;1991;"This article addresses a prevalent and fundamental misunderstanding of Victor Turner's theory of ""ritual anti-structure."" At the center of scholarly misinterpretation, and of this article, are Turner's key concepts, ""ritual liminality"" and ""ritual communitas."" Misreadings of ambiguous passages from Turner are herein clarified, challenging the literature's ""functionalist"" interpretation of Turner's theory. From the functionalist viewpoint, Turner appears to argue that ritual sublimates hostility toward social norms and thereby preserves them. However, this article systematizes Turner's discussion in a way that the prolific scholar did not, clarifying his thought in the process. The value of Turner's theory, properly understood, is demonstrated here by using his key concepts to illumine a case study of Pentecostal ritual, showing how such ritual supports one African-American congregation's efforts toward political and social change."
669;1991;This essay argues that Max Weber's life and work were significantly affected by his Christian faith tradition and world view, and that in this respect he is not to be differentiated from many early American sociologists. A significant point of differentiation occurs, however, in that Weber turned to the study of religion as a generic phenomenon, rather than simply writing about religious organizations or avoiding the topic altogether.
670;1991;"This paper is a response to Firebaugh and Harley (1991), as well as an attempt to enhance our understanding of age-related patterns in Protestant church attendance. Firebaugh's and Harley's arguments in favor of an ""age effects only"" model of Protestant church attendance are not compelling. Most importantly, age effects that are attributable to family formation sociologically imply cohort effects since there are substantial differences among cohorts in their propensity to form ""traditional"" nuclear families. In a new data analysis, I have empirically grounded age and cohort effects in the process of family formation. This analysis of 1972-90 General Social Survey data establishes that family structure variation partially explains both cohort effects and age effects on Protestant church attendance. These results, in addition to their intrinsic interest, considerably increase the plausibility of the age, period, and cohort interpretation versus the ""age effects only"" interpretation of Protestant church attendance."
671;1991;This paper offers a systematic outline and discussion of Victor Turner's anthropology of religion and ritual. Along with an examination of Turner's theoretical stance, an account of his personal life history is presented. Attention is paid to Turner's initial functional analysis, the development of his methodological frame and processual mode of analysis, and his conception of anti-structure. This account will serve to elaborate on some important issues in the study of ritual and religion. First, the discussion focuses on the parallels between Turner's life and the innovations in his approach. Second, his notion of religion in the study of ritual is examined. Finally, the distinctiveness, value, and limitations of his work are analyzed with reference to other approaches in symbolic anthropology.
672;1991;This study analyzed religious marriage patterns among Australian couples. Results obtained by log-linear modeling techniques indicated that husbands and wives tend to choose conjugal partners with religious identifications, or non-identifications, identical to their own. Homogeneity along religious and non-religious lines is a characteristic feature of Australian marriage patterns. This pattern is strongest among Other Protestants, notably weaker among Catholics, Liberal Protestants, and Independents, and weakest of all among Anglicans.
673;1991;This study investigates the effects of premillennialist theological beliefs on attitudes about political participation among members of the Indiana and Arkansas chapters of the Moral Majority. Premillennialism was found to increase positive attitudes toward political activity by inculcating beliefs about an active Devil taking part in human affairs, and to decrease the perceived efficacy of political participation by engendering beliefs that political activity is futile in the face of the coming millennium. This was found to produce a significant level of cognitive dissonance among Moral Majority members.
674;1991;This study tested multi-level models that represented relationships among individual-level and community-level measures of religiosity and measures of deviant behavior that individuals reported they would be likely to commit. Data came from 2,667 adult Catholics surveyed as part of the Notre Dame Study of Catholic Parish Life. Results from multivariate analyses supported the argument that the level of religiosity within a given social context affects projected deviance, although there was no evidence of any substantial interaction between personal- and community-level religiosity. Results also suggested that contextual effects are not necessarily consistent across all types of deviance.
675;1991;"Two basic approaches to reducing the perceived religion/science conflict are: a) to alter either religious teachings or scientific theories, or b) to create a better understanding of the differences between science and religion. For example, an attempt to reduce perceived conflict through the use of new scientific data has been made by R. W. Sperry, whose discussion of the religious implications of recent developments in cognitive psychology is presented here, along with some related developments in an area called ""chaos."" It is argued that these developments do not support religious concepts. However, they may serve as a source of analogies or new ways of thinking to aid in the understanding of religious concepts."
676;1991;"Using the Adjective Check List (Gough and Heilbrun 1983) and observational studies, research during the 1970s concluded that ""Christ Commune"" members demonstrated traits that could be characterized as ""maladaptive"" and ""addictive"" and that, in light of the resocialization process observed, this group stood to suffer psychologically upon leaving the insulation of the commune and returning to mainstream society. The study at hand examined 128 former Shiloh (""Christ Commune"") members using the same Adjective Check List ten years after the final dissolution of Shiloh. These subjects seemed to demonstrate personality characteristics remarkably different from the earlier samples and generally more similar to normative samples."
677;1991;While a variety of operational measures have been employed to identify fundamentalist respondents, little attention has been paid to assessing the effects of particular operational measures. Using data from a national survey containing several conventional measures of fundamentalism, this study analyzes (1) the extent to which these operational measures of fundamentalism are interrelated and tap the same facet of the concept, and (2) how these measures are related to criterion variables assumed to be associated with fundamentalism. In so doing, the study reveals just how the choice of an operational measure influences one's substantive findings.
678;1991;While there is a growing body of research on the relationship between religion and juvenile delinquency, relatively little is known about the effect of religion on compliance with the law among adults. Using survey data from a sample of adults, this study investigates the effects of affiliation with a fundamentalist denomination and personal religiosity on respondents' intentions to commit three offenses: tax cheating, theft, and littering. Alternative hypotheses were developed from the Tittle and Welch extension of the anti-asceticism hypothesis and from Hirschi's control theory. The data provided partial support for each perspective but full support for neither. We conclude by suggesting that future research consider the different processes through which religion might promote compliance with the law.
679;1992;"A comparison is made here between the societal responses to new religious movements in Europe and the United States on the one hand, and Israeli responses to the Hare Krishna movement and to the movement for teshuvah (the ""return"" of secular Jews to Orthodox Judaism) on the other hand. Reactions to NRMs in Israel can be understood in the context of a close association between religion and state, the near monopoly of Orthodox Judaism in the provision of religious services, a division between religious and secular sectors, and the association of Judaism with Jewish-Israeli national identity. In contrast to other western societies, the most active and effective anti-cult activities in Israel have been initiated and carried out by religious interests and organizations, and especially by the ultra-Orthodox who are themselves involved in the conversion of secular Jews to a religious perspective. Even though secular Jews have depicted ISKCON and teshuvah as having similar negative effects (the break with families and the losses to the army, economy, and social welfare), the response to teshuvah has been more ambiguous than the wholly negative response to ISKCON. Whereas Israeli members of ISKCON have rejected the symbolic center of the state and society, the values and behavior in teshuvah are linked to the identity of most secular Jewish Israelis."
680;1992;"Although Swanson's (1967) ""Religion and Regime"" is highly regarded by sociologists, it has spurred little additional work on the sociology of the Reformation. Those who have investigated the Reformation, mainly historians, have tended to ignore Swanson. This study takes a fresh look at the same Durkheimian concern which interested Swanson, namely, the possible link between social structure and a belief in immanence, in the specific case of Italy. Protestantism had some early and limited successes in northern Italy, mainly because of the presence of indigenous religious traditions which (like Protestantism) rejected immanence. Southern Italy, by contrast, never developed any indigenous immanence-rejecting traditions which could serve to ""pull in"" Protestantism. This is attributed in part to the fact that local communities in the South were often organized around a ""chiesa ricettizia,"" a type of church that has been well studied by Italian scholars but generally ignored by English-speaking investigators."
681;1992;An examination of the religious affiliations of members of Congress and of the American people showed that, in a religious sense, Congress is only partially representative of Americans. Liberal Protestants, Jews, and Mormons are over-represented in Congress, while conservative Protestants and people with no religious affiliation are under-represented. The religious affiliation of a member of Congress influences that person's party and policy preferences. However, if the composition of Congress were changed to be more religiously representative, congressional policy would change only slightly.
682;1992;"Attribution researchers, in focusing almost exclusively on people's secular explanations of behavior, have tended to neglect the role of religious concepts in the attribution process. This experiment tested a series of hypotheses, all emanating from the ""availability hypothesis"" (Spilka et al. 1985), concerning factors that affect the use of religious and secular attributions. A total of 183 subjects who varied in their commitment to the tenets of conservative Christianity were presented a series of vignettes describing everyday behavior and were asked to attribute the behavior to religious causal agents (God, Satan) or to secular causal agents (chance, dispositional, or situational factors). The results confirmed several hypotheses about attributions to God and Satan, but none of the hypotheses about the use of secular factors. Even so, subjects relied much more heavily on secular than on religious explanations of everyday behavior. The pattern of results suggests that the explanatory system underlying religious attributions might exemplify a multiple necessary schema rather than a multiple sufficient schema (Kelley 1972)."
683;1992;Have the extra-religious functions of black congregations become attenuated in recent decades? We have addressed this question here via a comparative analysis of black and white churches with the only extant national probability sample of U.S. congregations. We found that in 1988 black congregations were not more active in secular activities in general, but they were significantly more active in certain kinds of non-religious activity: (a) activity directed at serving disprivileged segments of the immediately surrounding community, and (b) civil rights activity. The observed differences between black and white congregations in these activities were not explained by differences in congregational size, resources, urban/rural setting, or southern/non-southern location. These results support the idea that black congregations continue to perform non-religious functions within their communities, although an intriguing interaction between race and a congregation's founding date points to important variation within black religion.
684;1992;In this research, Durkheim's theory of the universalization of religious beliefs is extended to analyze the occurrence of religious rituals. Drawing upon Schutz's phenomenology of social relations, we amplify theoretically the Durkheimian perspective and suggest that the universalization process is stimulated by an increase in anonymity (as opposed to intimacy) in society. Structural factors consistent with anonymity -- i.e., increasing population density, political and economic differentiation, and monetary exchange -- are hypothesized to influence the universalization of ritual occasions. A recursive path model is devised for the hypothesized relationships in the universalization process. We find support for the model using data from a cross-cultural sample of nonindustrial societies. The implications of these results for understanding religious rituals in contemporary complex societies are then discussed.
685;1992;"In this study, 190 female trainee teachers from Bar-Ilan University in Israel completed the Hebrew version of the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire and the Katz religiosity scale. The data suggest four conclusions: a) religiosity is associated with neither neuroticism nor emotional stability; b) religiosity is associated with neither introversion nor extraversion; c) religiosity has a positive relationship with tendermindedness, and a negative relationship with toughmindedness and psychoticism; and d) there is a positive relationship between religiosity and lie scale scores. These Israeli findings are consistent with the developing consensus regarding the relationship between personality and religion in predominantly Christian cultures."
686;1992;In this study, the integrative complexity of reasoning about three different types of religious issues was examined in a sample of 60 adults across the lifespan. Men and women, aged 18-26, 27-45, and 60-85, were asked about their current beliefs, justifications, and views on alternative positions regarding a personally conflictful religious issue of their own report, a personally nonconflictful issue, and a standard dilemma involving evolutionist versus creationist accounts of human origins. Results showed that older adults reasoned less complexly than did their younger counterparts in all three types of religious dilemmas. As predicted, personally conflictful dilemmas were discussed in a more complex fashion than were other types of dilemmas across age groups, suggesting that external dialogue about issues is linked to more sophisticated mental structures of argumentation. A summary regression analysis showed that those who were older, more orthodox, reported less religious reflection, and had poorer verbal skills, displayed less complex religious reasoning overall.
687;1992;"Instances in which persons believe they are in contact with the dead occur quite frequently, but sociological research into these events has been minimal. In this analysis, a logistic regression model was developed to predict the odds of experiencing what has been called ""contact with the dead,"" ""post-death contact,"" and for the purpose of this research, an ""idionecrophany."" The study examines how gender, race, and religious imagery influence the social construction of such experiences. When the effects of age, death trauma, and religious fundamentalism/liberalism were controlled, females were found to have higher odds of experiencing an idionecrophany than were males. An interaction effect between race and image of God was also discovered: Blacks had higher odds than whites of experiencing an idionecrophany when God was imagined as a ""Judge,"" while whites had higher odds when God was imagined as a ""Lover."""
688;1992;"Intrinsic, extrinsic, and quest religious orientations were used here to predict the desire to read belief-supporting and belief-opposing religious articles among a sample of Christian fundamentalists. As expected, both the intrinsic and quest orientations predicted the desire to read the belief-supportive articles. Only quest predicted the willingness to read the belief-opposing articles; however, two recent versions of the quest scale were significantly better than two earlier scales. It is argued that these findings offer more direct support for the construct validity of intrinsic and quest religiosity than do their many social and personal correlates which have been documented through the years."
689;1992;Previous work on religion and suicide has pursued a number of themes. The present work tested a new perspective which stresses the extent of social support networks in religions as protections against suicide. This study employed micro-level data on suicide attitudes as a check on previous findings based on ecological data. An analysis of national data from the General Social Surveys tended to support network theory. Churches promoting network involvement were found to have lower levels of suicide ideology. In particular, churches with conservative theologies, nonecumenical relations, and/or whose teachings are in tension with the larger society have lower levels of suicide ideology. These findings were independent of control variables drawn from alternative theories of suicide.
690;1992;"Since its publication in 1912, Durkheim's ""Elementary Forms"" has been scrutinized in great detail, but researchers have mostly neglected or accepted uncritically Durkheim's brief discussion of Buddhism at the beginning of Book One. Such disregard is remarkable since Durkheim relied on his interpretation of Buddhism to support two crucial claims in his definition of religious phenomena: that gods or spirits are not essential to religion, for Buddhism has no meaningful gods or spirits; and that the sacred-profane dichotomy is characteristic of all religions, since it is found even in an atheistic religion like Buddhism. We examine Durkheim's discussion to show that, despite qualifications and caveats, his claims regarding Buddhism are flawed on both counts. On the one hand, we show that Buddhism admits the existence of supra-mundane beings not as a secondary, but as a primary component of its religion; on the other hand, we demonstrate that the distinction between sacred and profane is marginal to Buddhist thought."
691;1992;The 1980s was an important period of time in the political life of American evangelicals. While evangelicals entered the decade as relatively apolitical citizens (Wuthnow 1983) with predominantly Democratic partisan orientations (Hunter 1983), both of these political traits appeared to be changing during Reagan's tenure in office. Since these changes were closely tied to the presidential candidacies of Ronald Reagan, it was unclear what would happen once he was absent from the ticket. This research note examines evangelical involvement in the 1988 general election in comparison to the 1980 and 1984 presidential elections. In so doing, it seeks to ascertain whether the recent changes among evangelicals are likely to become permanent features of the political landscape.
692;1992;The influence of religion on alcohol use is now a well-studied phenomenon. Past research has shown that religiosity is inversely related to use, and that the strength of this relationship varies across faith groups in a manner consistent with their theological postures. In this study, we have extended the examination of the effect of faith groups on alcohol use by looking at the joint influence of religious stability and homogamy. Using data from the NORC General Social Surveys, we found that the strength of the religiosity-alcohol use relationship varies predictably across childhood religion, respondent's current affiliation, and spouse's current affiliation.
693;1992;"The present article reports two studies in which the validity of the Defining Issues Test (DIT; Rest 1979) for conservative religious people was examined. In Study 1 we found that from 16 to 25 (of 72) DIT items had differential functioning; that is, the items were measuring a different construct for conservative religious subjects. Study 2 provided evidence that a large proportion of the differential item functioning observed in Study 1 was due to the religious connotations these items had for the religious subjects. We concluded that the DIT is not completely valid for people from some conservative religious cultures. Our studies join with other research in providing evidence that Kohlberg's theory of moral development is to some extent religiously and culturally limited."
694;1992;This field study deals with considerations underlying parents' choices of religious vs. secular elementary public education for their children. The contributions of parental religiosity, religious educational attitudes, subjective norms, and a variety of sociodemographic characteristics were examined within the context of a structural model suggested by reasoned action theory and its critics. Questionnaires dealing with these variables were administered to 710 parents of children completing kindergarten and about to enter elementary school. As expected, choice of school sector was related primarily to level of parental religiosity. LISREL analyses revealed that the parental decision was also influenced by such school characteristics as educational level and geographical location, as well as by perceived social norms. The specific weight of the variable shifted as a function of parental educational level and ethnicity. Social implications are discussed regarding the potential for social cleavage and separatism between religious and nonreligious Israeli Jews.
695;1992;This investigation proposes and tests a conceptual model of adolescent religious belief and commitment which was informed by recent advances in measurement theory and scale constrution. The model is a partial conceptual replication of Cornwall's 1988 study of Mormon adult religious development. The model was examined by looking at the linear structural relations from the covariance matrix of relations in a large survey of adolescent religious attitudes and behavior conducted in late 1988 and early 1989. The proposed model was specified, modified, and re-specified. The final fit of the model to the data was quite good, especially when one considers that the survey used for this study was originally prepared for another purpose. Finally, the implications of this new model and additional research strategies and questions are suggested.
696;1992;"This investigation sought to clarify the relationship between the normative aspects of sexuality, specifically premarital sexual permissiveness, and religiousness as measured by the I, Ep, and Es subscales of Allport's Religious Orientation Scale (ROS). A sample of 204 undergraduate students was used. Partial correlations, with controls for the effects of age, gender, and ethnic affiliation, indicated 1) a replication of previous findings that the I subscale (but not E) was positively associated with church attendance and self-reported religiosity; 2) that Es was positively associated with church attendance; 3) that I was negatively related to permissiveness; and 4) the non-intuitive result that Ep subscale scores were positively related to permissiveness. These data suggest that future use of an I/Ep/Es approach might provide valuable information on the development of normative aspects of premarital sexuality."
697;1992;This is the second in a series of investigations into the role of religion in the coping process. This study examined the relationship of intrinsic, extrinsic, and quest religious orientations to religious and nonreligious coping with a significant negative life event in a sample of 538 mainstream Christian church members. As predicted, each orientation was associated with a different way of coping with specific life problems. When coupled with the results in the first of this series of studies, these findings suggest that religious coping efforts might bridge the general religious orientation of the individual to the outcomes of critical life events. They point to the importance of the working of religion in specific life situations.
698;1992;This paper deals with the relationships among social status, race, and religion in the contemporary United States. The religious data came from the 1990 National Survey of Religious Identification and a sub-sample of 84,469 non-Hispanic white and 8,859 non-Hispanic black adult respondents distributed across 14 religious groups. Educational attainment, i.e., high school and college graduation rates, was used as a measure of social status. Three issues were examined. First, does the historical pattern of social ranking among religious groups still exist in the 1990s? Second, do African-Americans fit the dominant pattern? Third, do national white-black educational disparities occur across all religious groups?
699;1992;"This paper demonstrates how ""Soldier of Fortune"" magazine can be read as an apocalyptic text which expresses a postmodern and secular form of the classical millennial myth. The millennial myth has accompanied the development of numerous emancipatory and utopian movements in the 2,000 year history of Christianity. In its American form, the myth renders America as the millennial ""Redeemer Nation,"" and it has played an important role in the nation's history and culture. ""Soldier of Fortune"" and the survivalist subculture it represents (including literature, products, and conventions) demonstrate the way the millennial myth becomes altered in form, redefined, and reproduced in the mass media and popular culture. The power of religious myths such as the millennial myth lie in their persistence and adaptability to changing times. The data were collected from a sample of ""Soldier of Fortune"" magazines 1983-1990; additional information derived from a study of the 15th Anniversary ""Soldier of Fortune"" Convention and Exposition held in Las Vegas, Nevada, in September 1990."
700;1992;"This paper derives from a multi-method study of religion and politics in a mid-sized northeastern city. Whereas most assessments of secularization are oriented either to the individual or to broad societal trends, this one concerns the dynamics of religion and politics at the community level. After presenting a condensed ethnography, the article explores its theoretical implications with reference to the larger literature on secularization. As others before us have shown, secularization is not to be equated with religious disappearance; indeed, secularization and sacralization are often dialectically linked and more complementary than mutually exclusive. We pursue the oscillation between them through a series of ten conceptual distinctions derived from the case at hand."
701;1992;"This paper examines a battery of questions on personal religiosity that were included for the first time in the 1988 General Social Survey. Combined into a composite measure, the questions predict privatized religion in American society. Privatized religion (""Sheilaism"") was found to vary inversely with institutional religious loyalty. Men, whites, young Americans, liberal Protestants, Nones, and people living in the Pacific states and in New England are apparently the most privatized."
702;1992;This paper reports the findings of an exploratory study on astrology and its constituency. To date, there have been few sociological studies of astrology, and little is known about what types of people are interested in the practice. This study's focus was on adherents of astrology who attended an astrology conference. Unlike previous research, the findings of this study show that the characteristics of these astrologers reflect those of the general population, providing a new understanding of a segment of astrology's constituency.
703;1992;"This project consisted of three studies which empirically examined the hypothesis that the Western god-concept is male. A distinction was made between personal god-concepts and the cultural god-concept, and both types of god-concept were examined. Three methodologies were used: free response descriptions, cued response descriptions, and questionnaires. The results indicate that people 1) spontaneously use male language when talking about their god-concepts; 2) are more likely to describe God as a father than as a mother in both their personal god-concepts and cultural god-concepts; 3) when they are willing to consider a mother image, they do so in conjunction with a father image; and 4) when asked to provide a physical description of the cultural god-concept, overwhelmingly specify male."
704;1992;"This replication/trend study presents a ten-year follow-up of research on religiosity and social justice concerns among college students in England and the United States. The original study, based on data collected during 1978-79 (N = 1,197) at five diverse colleges and universities in the two countries, was replicated during 1988-90 (N = 1,102) at the same institutions with the same survey instrument. With controls for students' social background characteristics, results in each country consistently failed to reveal high religiosity as an ""opiate"" inherently fostering less compassionate, inegalitarian, or racist attitudes. Rather, in both time periods strong religious commitment was linked to heightened humanitarianism and a reduction in prejudice. However, nominal or moderate religiosity, as opposed to no religious allegiance, was associated with more racist viewpoints, a cross-national finding persisting over time."
705;1992;This research addressed the relationship of religious orientation and race to attitudes toward the death penalty. Analysis of data from the 1988 General Social Survey suggested that fundamentalism, evangelism, and devotionalism play significant but substantively different roles in the structuring of death penalty attitudes. Moreover, the correlation of such religious variables with support for capital punishment was found to vary by race. In addition, the results of this study suggest the need for a theoretical clarification of certain concepts in the sociology of religion.
706;1992;"This research examined the influence of religious denomination and church attendance on spousal violence, as measured by the Conflict Tactics Scales (Straus 1979). The data came from a representative national probability sample of the Canadian ever-married or cohabiting population, 18 years or older. Religious denomination was not found to be significantly related to spousal abuse. Also, the ""religious patriarchy"" thesis was not supported: Conservative Christian men do not abuse their partners significantly more often than do affiliates of other denominations, but Conservative Christian women appear to do so. Also, the relationship between church attendance, as an indicator of religious commitment, and spousal violence was weak and curvilinear. These results provided modest support for the Allport and Ross (1967) intrinsic-extrinsic conceptualization. Spousal violence was also examined in conjunction with sociodemographic and spousal interaction factors. When three multivariate models were applied, it was found that religion had little, if any, relationship to spousal abuse. Other variables, mainly spousal interaction factors, were found to be the best overall predictors of such physical abuse."
707;1992;"This study analyzed voting data for leftist candidates in the 1920 and 1924 presidential elections, as well as data on the location of I.W.W. branches in 1924, to assess the Marxist thesis that religion is an ""opium of the people."" We used the 48 states as the units of analysis and found solid negative correlations between church membership rates and leftism. However, these correlations all turned out to be spurious; they disappeared when controls were added for the percent of the population born in Scandinavia. A lack of Scandinavians also accounted for the weakness of leftist parties in the American South. It is no doubt far more exciting to blame fulminating fundamentalism for the absence of ""true class consciousness"" in the South, and in the nation more generally. However, Marxist doctrines have fallen on hard times of late and that seems to have been the case here too."
708;1992;This study employs a perspective of religious behavior based largely on classic deprivation theory and on the Stark and Bainbridge theory of religion. It is proposed that religions provide services, such as eschatological explanations, and hope and comfort, and that individual religiosity will increase as desire for these services increases. Survey data on religious beliefs and behavior collected by the Institute of Statistical Mathematics in Tokyo were used. Results lend partial support for the theoretical perspective. Some measures of an increased desire for these services were correlated with an increased likelihood of exhibiting related religious beliefs and behavior.
709;1992;This study examined the relationship between aging and religious participation, focusing on changes in older people's formal participation in church life, informal or private religious practices, and attitudes towards participation in the church. Survey data from a random sample of older persons in a medium-sized northeastern city included both objective and subjective measures of health. Contrary to earlier studies which relied on subjective health as the sole indicator of health status, multiple regression analyses showed that health, especially as measured by health-related, functional limitations, serves an important mediating role. Older people experience greater functional limitations and, in turn, are less likely to engage in various church activities. These findings have important implications for the activity-disengagement debate within social gerontology and also for the concern in the sociology of religion with the role of religion in older people's lives.
710;1992;"This study examines the ideological and structural bases for attitudes and political action relating to abortion. Data on abortion attitudes from a random sample of ""Middletown"" in the fall of 1989 (N = 400) indicated that the strongest effects on abortion attitude stemmed from a belief that life begins at conception, a belief in privacy rights, and religion. Social traditionalism was also found to play an important role in a pro-life stand, but it was influential only for conservative Protestants and not for Catholics. A general commitment to avoid taking anyone's life was significantly related to abortion attitudes but only for Catholics. For political action, the data showed that the pro-life movement was still more important in 1989 than was the pro-choice movement. Party identification was not related to an expressed willingness to use abortion as a political litmus test, but attending pro-life churches did increase the likelihood that pro-life adherents would use abortion in making voting decisions."
711;1992;"This study investigated the impact of metropolitan size on participation in Protestant, Catholic, and Jewish subcommunities in the United States. Hypotheses were based on Durkheim's theory of community, the Blau and Schwartz macrostructural theory of group relations, and Fischer's subculture theory. The major hypotheses were: 1) The larger the religio-ethnic subcommunity, the less its members participate formally (e.g., organizational membership); 2) the larger the Jewish or Catholic subcommunity, the more its members will participate informally (e.g., within-group friendship); 3) the smaller the religio-ethnic group, the more its members are affected by community size; and 4) the majority subcommunity will be relatively impervious to the effects of community size. Hypothesis 1, 3, and 4 were supported by data from the 1985-1989 General Social Surveys of the National Opinion Research Center and from the National Jewish Population Survey of 1970-71. Hypothesis 2 could be tested only in the Jewish community and was supported."
712;1993;A dimension of religiousness alternately referred to as orthodoxy or fundamentalism correlates more strongly with prejudice than do other religiosity measures. However, recent theoretical and psychometric work suggest that orthodoxy and fundamentalism should be distinguished both empirically and conceptually, and that the two variables may relate differentially to discriminatory attitudes toward various targets. Five samples of college students, representing three universities and colleges in the United States and Canada (total N = 426) completed several religion scales and measures of discriminatory attitudes toward blacks, women, homosexuals, and communists. Fundamentalism was correlated more positively than Christian orthodoxy with discriminatory attitudes toward all targets. In multiple regression equations, fundamentalism was positively related to all measures of discriminatory attitudes, whereas Christian orthodoxy and intrinsic religious orientation were either unrelated or negatively related to these variables.
713;1993;"A long research tradition examines the relationships between religion and parental values, defined broadly as the traits that adults find most desirable in children. Two such traits have been of particular interest: ""obedience"" and ""intellectual autonomy."" We argue that contemporary Conservative Protestants are prone to endorse authoritarian parenting orientations disproportionately -- that is, to value obedience at the expense of autonomy. In addition, contrary to the thrust of some previous research, we hypothesize that Catholics tend to embrace more authoritarian child-rearing values than do non-Conservative Protestants and other Americans. OLS regression and structural equation models confirm that Conservative Protestants are especially supportive of obedience. However, they are no less enthusiastic than others about intellectual autonomy in children. Conservative Protestant valuation of obedience is linked with three theological positions: biblical literalism, belief that human nature is sinful, and punitive attitudes toward sinners. Hypotheses regarding Catholics are also confirmed, although the magnitude of Catholic effects is less pronounced. Several directions for future research on religious differences in parent-child relations are recommended."
714;1993;Although the general public supports the separation of church and state in the abstract, majorities support establishment positions on many concrete issues. Here I use LISREL to investigate the structure of attitudes toward establishment issues. The LISREL analysis suggests a surprising degree of both vertical and horizontal constraint on these issues, probably resulting from religious cues.
715;1993;An interview study of 500 young adults from 33 to 42 years old who grew up in Presbyterian churches provided data for testing the importance of specific determinants of church involvement. We posited a general theory of plausibility structures. We found influence of early religious socialization to be weak. The influence of cultural broadening during the college-age years was also weak, except that it liberalized beliefs. The strongest determinant of church involvement today was religious beliefs: Persons with conservative beliefs are more committed. Second strongest was recent adult experiences, especially regarding family. We propose here a two-step model, with belief formation most important and recent family experiences second most important.
716;1993;Bromley and Breschel's (1992) study of mass and elite attitudes constitutes one of the few attempts to analyze public tolerance of new religious movements (NRMs). I expand upon that study by applying multivariate analysis to its data and by considering differences in levels of NRM tolerance among elite sub-groups. I find that, while social and demographic variables are quite limited in predictive power, education is the most significant predictor of mass NRM tolerance. Significant relationships between NRM tolerance and education, age, income, and religious variables noted by Bromley and Breschel withstand multivariate analysis. As for intraelite differences, academics are the subgroup most tolerant of NRMs, while Christian clergy prove least tolerant. Finally, influences on NRM tolerance appear similar to those associated with civil tolerance.
717;1993;Caird's (1988) factor-analytic study of Hood's (1975) M-scale was replicated using adult subjects (N = 87) rather than college students. Subjects included contemplative mystics, psychotics with religious preoccupations, and other adults. As in Caird's (1988) findings, our study found two factors similar to Hood's two-component solution, reflecting Unitary and Interpretive categories of mystical experience. A three-factor solution splits the Interpretive category into Noetic/Ineffability and Religious types of interpretations. The factors in both solutions are intercorrelated. This study provides additional evidence for the stability of factorial structures across diverse samples and limited evidence for validity.
718;1993;Catholicism in the United States has often been characterized by internal and external critics alike as an anti-intellectual religious culture. This study reexamines the issue in light of new evidence, comparing Catholic and non-Catholic responses to items pertaining to orientation toward intellect in the 1988 General Social Survey. We found Catholics and non-Catholics to be virtually indistinguishable in their intellectual orientations even when education, birth cohort, and sex are controlled. In a more detailed analysis, however, we found Catholics to be significantly more positive on some measures of intellectual orientation than fundamentalist Protestants, but significantly less so than nonfundamentalist Protestants, Jews, and those with no religious affiliation. We explore the implications of these findings for the future intellectual vitality of American Catholicism.
719;1993;"In sociology, studies of social change in the non-Western world have not assigned a prominent role to missionary organizations. This relative neglect is the product of two assumptions: first, that missions abroad were ineffective as agents of fundamental social change; and, second, that their activities were shaped more by powerful secular agendas over which they had little control than by autonomous religious interests. Contrary to the first assumption, there is ample evidence that some missions were impressive agents of social transformation; contrary to the second, some of them took a stand in direct opposition to the secular political and economic interests to which they are often considered subordinate. Together these observations reinforce the concept of the relative autonomy of religion. I argue here that one key to understanding mission resistance to powerful nonreligious forces can be found in religious conceptions of the proper relationships among land, labor, and community stability. When these are threatened, the symbiosis between religious and secular interests can give way to open and effective defiance."
720;1993;In this study, a state measure for Pargament's Self-Directing, Deferring, and Collaborative religious coping styles was developed to evaluate situational and personal variations in religious coping. Vignettes were used to vary situations. The state coping subscales were significantly correlated with their respective trait counterparts. Situational variability in religious coping style was established and related to the characteristics of the situations and the individuals. A more active role was assigned to God for the state coping styles than was indicated by the trait measures. In addition, increased perception of stressors (stress, importance, challenge, loss, and threat) in the vignettes was correlated with a more active role for God and a less active role for the individual.
721;1993;Large congregations are often plagued by free-riders -- members who participate, but do not contribute. However, large congregations also enjoy lower costs per member. On balance, as congregations grow, their revenues rise faster than the costs of providing services to their members. The extra monies fund disproportionate amounts of local benevolence programs and synodical and national church ministries. Unfortunately, large congregations have not parlayed their financial advantage into membership gains. Since increased benevolence boosts external ministry to others more than internal ministry to members themselves, members of small congregations have little incentive to move to larger, more efficient ones. Small congregations continue to survive and members will not passively abandon them.
722;1993;"Most Americans believe there is life after death. Based on General Social Survey data, belief in an afterlife changed very little among adults in the United States between 1973 and 1991. By examining change within birth cohorts as well as across cohorts, we determined the proximate sources of this stability, with unexpected results. We found no evidence that belief increases notably with age; nor was there any evidence that belief is declining with successive birth cohorts. Because belief neither increases much with age nor declines across cohorts, the aggregate trend is nearly flat. Indeed, the most interesting thing about belief in an afterlife in the United States is what it is not doing: It is not declining."
723;1993;Newly available data confirm previous claims that Europe abounds in new religious movements and that most European nations have rates far higher than does the United States. I also address objections that a count of movements is not a count of members.
724;1993;"On the basis of research into alternative women's roles in eight new religious movements, this study addresses conflicting views concerning the relationship between gender role ambiguities and women's participation in the sexual innovations developing in NRMs, summed up as the ""empowerment"" versus the ""neopatriarchy"" school of thought. A close study of the literature and histories of these groups suggests that they are more varied, flexible, and experimental in their patterns of sexuality than previous studies would indicate; and that, for the majority of members, involvement is a transitory phenomenon, providing them with opportunities for participating in laboratories of sexual experimentation. Adopting a ""gendered"" approach to the issue of ""cult conversion,"" this study argues that contemporary women find protective, supportive microsocieties in NRMs, which enable them to try out a spectrum of clearly defined roles that prepare them to choose a more personally gratifying adult mode when they eventually defect. By temporarily inhabiting the stylized feminine roles in NRMs and submitting to their leaders' erotic/ascetic ordeals, members appear to undergo a self-imposed psychological metamorphosis, or ""cocoon work,"" which in many ways resembles the ritual process found in feminine rites of passage in traditional societies."
725;1993;Previous research on lifestyle changes within U.S. Catholic religious orders has neglected to examine the extent to which their members still live communally. In this study, the archives of eight religious congregations of women were examined for 1964 and 1990 to determine changes in living patterns. When compared with 1964, sisters in 1990 lived in much smaller groups and in apartments rather than convents. The composition of the 1990 groups was also much more stable over time. Possible reasons for these changes are explored.
726;1993;Psychometric analysis confirmed that the Allport-Ross Religious Orientation Scale measures three distinct dimensions of religiousness: I, Ep, and Es. On the basis of this analysis a more internally consistent intrinsic scale was proposed. Comparisons of five religious groups indicated that religious affiliation mediated relationships between religious orientation and independent variables. Intrinsicness predicted lower depression for Christian respondents but was unrelated to depression for the non-Christian subsamples. Ep and Es were significantly related to higher depression for Unitarians. Low reliabilities for the extrinsic subfactor scales may be remedied by adding three new items to each scale.
727;1993;"The major findings in this nationwide sample of six Protestant denominations were: (1) Endorsement of New Age beliefs such as astrology and reincarnation was in frequent (7-9%). In contrast, attitudinal statements supportive of New Age ideologies were endorsed by nearly a third of the respondents. (2) Southern Baptists were particularly low in their endorsement of these beliefs and attitudes; no denomination was particularly high. (3) These beliefs and attitudes apparently were unrelated to other measures of religiousness, satisfaction with one's present congregation or denomination, and most demographic variables, except for a negative relation between education and both astrology and the belief that ""all spiritual truth is within me."" There was also evidence that these beliefs were more common among theological liberals."
728;1993;The present study investigated perceived religious consensus between adolescents and their fathers in a sample of 125 Jewish adolescents. Data from this study were generally consistent with earlier research showing the effects of father's communication and father's emotional support on religious consensus between fathers and their adolescent sons and daughters. In the present sample, however, father's denominational affiliation appeared to have mediating effects for sons, but not for daughters. Possible differences between denominations were hypothesized to account for these effects.
729;1993;The traditional paradigm in the sociology of religion sees strength in religious monopolies, attributing to them the ability to sustain an unchallenged, taken-for-granted sacred canopy. The newer paradigm regards religious monopolies as weak, locating religious vitality in pluralism and competition. A crucial test of these competing paradigms arises in the hypothesis that rank-and-file Catholic commitment varies inversely to the proportion nominally Catholic within any appropriate set of units of analysis. Results based on the 102 Roman Catholic dioceses of the United States show that ordination rates, the ratio of priests to nominal Catholics, and Catholic school enrollment are proportionately highest where Catholics are few. Results based on the 50 states show the same inverse relationship between the percent Catholic and the ratio of priests to Catholics. These data also show that the smaller a state's Catholic minority, the higher the circulation rate of the Catholic Digest.
730;1993;Theories of the new class stress the powerful liberalizing effects of working in the professional-managerial occupations. This paper tests the relative importance of class and religious subculture in predicting political and social attitudes, by looking at the views of evangelicals who work in the new class. Multivariate regression analyses reveal that religious subculture and class are both highly significant predictors of ideological position on sexual mores, abortion, sex roles, and civil liberties. Additionally, evangelical new-class workers resist the liberalizing effects of class more than other new class members on sexual mores, while accommodating to new-class liberalism on abortion, gender roles, and civil liberties.
731;1993;These remarks on Schaefer and Gorsuch's (1991) theory acknowledge the progress provided by their conception and also indicate some limits. They propose a more multivariate approach, which conceptualizes the fundamental dimensions of religiosity and considers more motives than the ROS and its revisions take into account.
732;1993;Thirty patients currently in residence at a psychiatric inpatient facility, meeting DSM-III-R criteria for psychotic disorders and having religious delusions, were given the Hood Mysticism Scale, Knoblauch's Ego Grasping Orientation Inventory (EGO Scale), and Raskin and Hall's Narcissistic Personality Inventory (NPI). Second, thirty senior members of various contemplative/mystical groups and thirty normal-appearing hospital staff were given the same battery. Results were analyzed using a multivariate discriminant analysis. Contemplatives and Psychotics taken together could be separated from Normals, but not from each other, with the Hood Mysticism Scale. The Normals and Contemplatives taken together could be separated from the Psychotics, but not from each other, with the EGO Scale and the NPI. A two-dimensional discriminant function based on the three tests correctly classified the Psychotics 92.6%, the Normals 79.3%, and the Contemplatives 70.0% of the time. For the Contemplative/Psychotic mixture taken alone, 90% of the Contemplatives and 92.6% of the Psychotics were correctly separated.
733;1993;"This essay is an attempt to expand a study reported in 1989 of the relationship between religion and concern for the environment in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Here, only one variable was used, willingness to spend money on the environment, but findings were based on a national data set. The finding of the Tulsa study is confirmed: Low levels of environmental concern correlate with a biblical literalism. They also correlate with being Christian and with confidence in the existence of God. On the other hand, support for environmental spending correlates positively with a gracious image of God and with being Catholic. However, explanatory models suggest that it is not biblical literalism as such which relates to lack of environmental concern, but rather a rigid political and religious ""story."""
734;1993;"This paper argues that the belief in and reverence for superhuman beings cannot be understood as the chief distinguishing characteristic of religious phenomena. The consideration of Buddhism has always been central to the discussion of what religion is, and this paper focuses on the limitations of the human-superhuman dichotomy as it might be used to apply to Buddhist traditions. The argument makes three points: a) There are important sects of Buddhism that do not rely on reverence for superhuman beings, and the concept ""superhuman"" is difficult (if not impossible) to use in cross-cultural studies because of cultural variations in what it means to be human; b) the insistence that ""philosophies"" should be systematically distinguished from ""religions"" is arbitrary and culturally biased; and c) Buddhist doctrines that assert that reality is ultimately ""nondual"" provide the conceptual context for understanding superhuman beings in Mahayana, and this conceptuality is not consonant with superhuman definitions of religion."
735;1993;This study examines the attitudes regarding civil religious issues that have developed among religious and nonreligious Jews in Israel and the perceptions of each group regarding the other. A considerable amount of social isolation characterizes the general relationships between religious and nonreligious Jews even when they live together. Both groups prefer their social contacts to be with persons of similar levels of religiosity. The subjects of this study, religious and nonreligious high school youth, were given closed questionnaires that dealt with religious observance, interpersonal contact with persons of different degrees of religiosity, tolerance for others and perceived tolerance of others for them, housing preferences, perceptions regarding religious and nonreligious groups in Israel, and attitudes relating to religion and state. The results indicate that the religious view themselves more positively than they view the nonreligious. The nonreligious view themselves as somewhat more tolerant of the religious than is perceived to be the case by the religious, but they also view the traits of the religious group quite positively. The comparison of Orthodox and ultra-Orthodox Jews suggests that the former are viewed more positively, and by way of contrast are more similar to the non-Orthodox. While the religious youth demonstrate some understanding of the nonreligious, they nevertheless wish religious practices to be adopted in civil law. I discuss the implications of the findings while analyzing avoidance as a conflict reduction mechanism for maintaining the fragile relationships between religious and nonreligious Jews in Israel.
736;1993;"This study tested the religious ecology hypothesis that postulates that religion is negatively related to delinquency only in a highly religious climate. Data were collected from a sample of 2,143 LDS youth living along the east coast during the spring of 1990. The link between religion and delinquency in this low-LDS religious climate was compared to the connection found in an earlier study of three highly moral communities, southern California, Idaho, and Utah. The religious ecology hypothesis was not supported; religiosity had a strong negative relationship to delinquency in both the high and low religious ecologies. In addition, a multivariate model allowed peer, family, and religious factors to compete to explain delinquency. The multivariate model revealed that although peer influence made the strongest contribution in the regression equation, religiosity also made a significant contribution."
737;1993;Using data from a survey of activists (N = 4,995) from several large religious interest groups, we analyze the impact of theological orientations on attitudes toward the environment. We find that doctrinal fundamentalism, carefully defined, is a powerful predictor of environmental preferences. We also discover that views on environmental policy are part of much more comprehensive religious and political world-views among these religious activists.
738;1993;Using data from state exit polls in 1990, we attempted to determine the manner in which Roman Catholicism affects abortion attitudes. We compared individual-level effects, in which the Church socializes individual members, with contextual effects, in which the Church affects abortion attitudes by altering the terms of the debate outside the Church's membership. Both effects were found to be statistically significant, although the contextual effects of Catholicism were negative. This suggests that the Catholic Church is rather effective in teaching antiabortion attitudes to its members, but that a strong Catholic presence in a particular state occasions countermobilization on the part of non-Catholics.
739;1993;"Using theoretical work by Lifton, psychologists of religion have reported some preliminary conceptual foundations for a theory of death transcendence and a five-factor scale to measure it. No published reports have tested this scale beyond the original authors' work with college students. Our study describes factor analysis and reliability results from its use with community persons (Study 1; N = 166) as well as hospital patients and family members of patients (Study 2; N = 273). Factor analyses in both studies supported the instrument's mystical, religious, and creative factors. The items related to the biosocial and nature factors tended to mingle with each other. Cronbach's alpha was .79 for Study 1 and .74 for Study 2."
740;1993;While membership in Catholic religious orders of women in the United States is declining, demographic data on religious orders worldwide show that growth and decline patterns vary significantly by continent. The data presented in this research note demonstrate a positive relationship between female opportunity in society and the decline of female religious orders, thereby supporting the argument that religious orders serve as avenues of social mobility for women. Since orders are growing in those nations with the smallest percentage of Catholics in the population, as well as with the smallest proportion of religious women, this paper concludes that the prognosis for the future of religious orders is not optimistic.
741;1994;3-D images effectively describe and analyze stability and change in church attendance continuously through time. Using locally weighted regression functions on 1972-1991 GSS data for church attendance by age for each subsample -- Protestants by sex and race and Catholics by sex -- we generate 3-D APC surfaces on church attendance. After reviewing alternative theoretical arguments (secularization to account for period effects and family formation to account for cohort effects in patterns of church attendance) we argue that the 3-D quasi-scenic images show the persistence of an age effect and the absence, in most cases, of either a period or cohort effect. For example, our images show that Protestants (male and female, black and white) report attending church more frequently as age increases up to about 70 years of age, then a lessening of attendance. White Catholics report sharply increasing church attendance that peaks about age 60 to 70, then decreasing attendance for the rest of the age range. In all of our comparisons, women report more frequent church attendance than men, and the gap between men and women increases throughout the life span. These surfaces, or similar graphic depictions, are essential starting points for statistical analysis.
742;1994;Although many studies suggest that religious participation enhances the social resources of individuals, there is little empirical evidence on this issue. This study develops a theoretical model linking institutional religious participation, social ties, and social support. Hypotheses derived from this model are then tested using data on a large (N = 2956) southeastern community sample. Frequent churchgoers report larger social networks, more contact with network members, more types of social support received, and more favorable perceptions of the quality of their social relationships than do their unchurched counterparts. Further, most of these empirical patterns withstand statistical controls for a wide range of covariates. A number of promising directions for future research on religious differences in social resources are identified.
743;1994;An adaptation of Fazio's (1986, 1989) attitude process theory is offered as a potentially valuable model for the psychology of religion. The concept of attitude is defined within this model as an association between an object and an evaluation of that object. Attitudes are characterized either as automatic activations that are spontaneous, inescapable, and lacking reflection or as controlled activations that require attention and are reflective and active in nature. I suggest that this distinction has important implications for the study of religious attitudes. The model as a whole is presented, an application to the psychology of religion is discussed, and potential benefits of adopting an attitude process approach to the psychology of religion are identified.
744;1994;"Analysis of the rhetoric of late nineteenth-century American Populism reveals it to be replete with religious language, symbolism, and references. Far from being incidental to Populism's basic message, the religious language was an important resource in the movement's ideology. Religious rhetoric, drawn particularly from American ""civil religious"" discourse, gave Populism a politically legitimate vocabulary and helped constitute the movement's attempt at striking a balance between individual liberty and communal equality. Religious themes were crucial to the movement's critique of its society and its prescription for a better world. We argue that such rhetoric is too often overlooked due to assumptions about Populism's essentially ""economic"" message; however, in order to understand Populism as a movement, it is necessary to understand the language with which it presented itself."
745;1994;"Between the 1960s and 1990s, a significant decline in participation in organized religion has occurred in Canada. The situation seemingly has provided less dominant religious groups -- including Conservative Protestants -- with an opportunity to expand their ""market shares."" By way of exploring such a possibility, we have been monitoring the growth patterns of 20 evangelical churches in a western Canadian city since the late 1960s. Our latest analysis of additions for 1986-90 reveals that recruitment beyond the evangelical community has increased only slightly. However, in reflecting on the project findings, we maintain that their past conclusions may have been excessively harsh, and draw attention to three shortcomings of the ""circulation of the saints"" thesis. We close with a discussion of some of the implications of the findings for Conservative Protestant activity elsewhere."
746;1994;Combining Pargament's (1990) theoretical framework of religion and coping with Spilka, Shaver, and Kirkpatrick's (1985) attributional theory to explain the role of religious causal attributions in coping with stress, this study extends the existing understanding of religion's role in coping with stress. We surveyed 131 university students who had experienced their parents' divorce during their own adolescence. Retrospective religious causal attributions predicted coping activities -- especially religious coping -- beyond measures of religiosity. Religious casual attributions may uniquely influence how people cope with stress.
747;1994;"Cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses were conducted to examine the relationship of religious and nonreligious coping methods to psychological distress among college students in the 1990-91 Gulf War crisis. Students completed measures of religious coping, nonreligious coping, and specific (war-related) and global psychological distress two days prior to the allied ground assault of Kuwait and one week after hostilities were suspended against Iraq. Religious coping activities were significant predictors of psychological distress cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Religious avoidant coping was associated with increased distress. Surprisingly, pleading for a miracle was tied to reduced distress over time. While religious and nonreligious coping were associated with each other, the two were not functionally redundant; each set of coping methods contributed unique variance to the prediction of distress. Differences between the cross-sectional and longitudinal findings suggest that stressful experiences may serve as a religious coping mobilizer and/or that the efficacy of religious coping methods may change over time. The results point to the need for finer-grained analyses of specific religious coping mechanisms in specific life situations."
748;1994;"Data collected in a multistage probability sample of Russian-speaking citizens of the Russian Federation in the spring and summer of 1991 (as part of the International Social Survey Program's study of Religion) indicate a substantial increase in religious belief and affiliation in the Federation. A third of the Russian people who said they once did not believe in God now do believe in God -- 22% of all Russians. There has also been a substantial affiliation with the Orthodox Church of those who were not previously members. The ""revivalists"" are disproportionately young and (relatively) disproportionately male. They tend to have become believers because of a ""religious turning point"" experience and to view the purpose of religion as giving a meaning and purpose to life. They propose to raise their children as religious and, like all Russians, to have a great respect for the Orthodox Church."
749;1994;Data from the Youth-Parent Socialization Panel Study (1965-1982) are used to test several hypotheses concerning religious disaffiliation and reaffiliation. What prompts a person to return to the fold, having earlier left it? Returning to religion is fostered by ties to family of origin and the formation of the family of procreation. However, the impact of the latter is gender-specific: Men are more affected than women by life-course transitions, a fact explained by the male's religious role being less institutionalized than the female's and therefore more contingent on nonreligious factors. Other possible influences on adolescent religious rebellion, such as the larger political context, are also examined.
750;1994;"Forty-five high and 44 low religious fundamentalists (drawn from a questionnaire study of 489 undergraduates) were interviewed to assess the integrative complexity of their thinking about a variety of topics. Interviewees discussed two vignettes (one familiar, the other relatively unfamiliar) in each of three different content domains (religious, ethical and environmental). Attempts were also made to increase individuals' integrative complexity of thought about each dilemma by means of several ""prodding"" questions. Across domains, complexity of thought was significantly higher for familiar than for unfamiliar vignettes. Also, we were successful in increasing respondents' complexity levels with our graduated prompts. Dispositional measures (religious fundamentalism, Christian orthodoxy, right-wing authoritarianism, dogmatism, and need for cognition) were related to complexity of thought, but these associations were not consistent across domains. In particular, we concluded that religious fundamentalism and orthodoxy were negatively related to complexity of thought for existential issues only, and a reconsideration of previous investigations suggested that this is in fact a consistent tendency in related research."
751;1994;"Freud (1927, 1930) claimed that devout, intrinsic religion buffers the threat of social isolation, rejection, and loneliness. We reasoned that if Freud was right, then reminding people of their vulnerability to loneliness should lead to increases in self-reported levels of intrinsic religion. To test this prediction, 72 undergraduates at least moderately interested in religion first completed three scales tapping different dimensions of personal religion: Intrinsic, Extrinsic, and Quest. About a week later, each subject performed a writing task that either did or did not make vulnerability to loneliness salient, and then completed the three religious orientation scales again. Supporting Freud's claim, high-loneliness-salience subjects reported higher scores on the Intrinsic scale on the second administration, whereas low-salience subjects did not. This effect was specific to the Intrinsic scale; there was no effect of loneliness-salience on either the Extrinsic or Quest scales."
752;1994;Hadaway, Marler, and Chaves (1993) have recently argued that U.S. weekly church attendance is about one-half the rate that is commonly accepted. Regarding Catholics, their result was based on head-count data from only 18 dioceses. The present paper is based on data from a total of 48 Catholic dioceses containing approximately 38% of U.S. Catholics. The results are the same: The weekly attendance rate in this expanded set of dioceses is 26.7%. These results lend further empirical support to the notion that church attendance rates based on self-reports are substantially inflated.
753;1994;In moving the social movement literature forward, researchers are now examining political discourse and the framing of protest language and symbols as important variables in movement processes. This case study on liberation theology in Peru analyzes how theologians have helped to mobilize Church activists, priests, sisters, and organizational resources to meet the political challenges of the popular sector by advancing liberation theology. More specifically, this paper looks at how Church leaders who are identified with liberation theology helped bridge different protest populations. Using oral histories methodology, I gathered data on liberation theology through field research conducted in Peru from September 1987 to May 1988 and in the summer of 1991.
754;1994;"In recent years, the consequences of religious market structures have become a significant research topic. It is maintained that religious market competition leads to the production of religious ""goods"" or services of the kind ""consumers"" demand. As a consequence, religious consumption tends to be higher in a free, competitive market than in a monopolistic or oligopolistic religious situation. Much of the research on the effects of religious market structures has been based on American data. In the present study, we test hypotheses derived from rational choice theory on contemporary Sweden, a country where the religious market structure differs notably from that of the United States. The unique Swedish church statistics enabled us to test the hypotheses that competition would induce churches to adapt to the demands of the consumers and that this adaptation would increase the level of religious consumption. The empirical results were consistent with our theoretical assumptions."
755;1994;"Intrinsic/extrinsic religious orientations have been critiqued for lacking the conceptual clarity needed for clear theory and good measurement. Allport provided little theoretical base except that of implicit ""functional autonomy"" and provided a scale that mixed beliefs, behaviors, and motivation. These critiques can be answered in part by clearly defining intrinsicness as motivational. General psychological research provides at least four theoretical bases for intrinsic religious motivation as affect and at least two bases for intrinsic religious motivation as value. That each theory may be appropriate for different people within any sample being researched needs to be explicitly taken into account in both research design and analysis. Conceptualizing intrinsicness as motivation provides a set of theories for examining both how intrinsic religious affect and value develop and how they affect religious and nonreligious behavior."
756;1994;"Most studies of work focus almost exclusively on secular antecedents of ""work commitment,"" ""work involvement,"" and work as a ""central life interest."" We argue that religion also influences the way people think of work. We use data from 1,869 Protestants and Catholics to test a theory that includes six religious factors, five work conditions, and other personal attributes. Work-related factors have the most effect, followed by religion, especially religious commitment and social justice beliefs. Among personal attributes, education, family income, and gender have a significant effect on orientations toward work."
757;1994;"Previous research indicates a qualitative difference in the religious expression of white and African-American congregations and suggests that these differences may influence the association between religion and health. The social support and religious consolation hypotheses are examined for main and interactive effects on health by race. A national sample of adults, Americans' Changing Lives, surveyed in 1986 is used for the analysis (N = 3,497). Three dimensions of religiosity are strongest among black adults and women; yet their health is generally poorer. Evidence for the social support hypothesis is found, but the effect on health is similar for black and white respondents. The religious consolation hypothesis is supported only among the black respondents. In addition, a positive link between religious practice and health was observed among African Americans."
758;1994;Sacredness and status have been two key concepts of classical sociological theory, but their interrelationship has seldom been discussed. The paper argues that sacredness is a special form of status. This conceptualization allows the use of common theoretical concepts and propositions to explain both status and sacral relationships. First, key processes relevant to the explanation of interpersonal status relations are outlined. Then the utility of this approach is illustrated by an analysis of worship and salvation as forms of status transformation. The analysis focuses on Christianity, but brief indications are given of how the perspective is also relevant to the analysis of Hindu worship and soteriology. The approach offers a prospect for a general integrated theory of status and sacral relationships.
759;1994;Social science research examining the relationship between religion and health has produced equivocal results, although evidence from more recent studies points toward a link between inward or intrinsic religion and both mental and physical well-being. This study offers a further examination of this emergent association by comparing the health status of two specific respondent groups drawn from a population of Canadian university students. The first consists of members of a range of campus Christian faith groups, and the second is a comparison or nonaffiliated group chosen from the student body at large. The results of the study reveal a positive relationship between faith group involvement and various aspects of health status, and thus support previous positive findings. At the same time, they reinforce the need for further research on the association between specific aspects of religiosity and well-being.
760;1994;The present investigation explores the influence of feminism/religiosity on attitudes toward suicide among national samples of 4,946 women and 4,475 men. Two models are tested. First, religiosity should have an impact on suicide ideology through lowering feminism. Second, feminism should have a positive impact on suicide ideology through lowering religiosity. A LISREL analysis finds support for both models, but the greatest support is found for the first. The impact of religion and feminism on suicide ideology are independent of standard sociodemographic predictors of pro-suicide ideology, including age, socioeconomic class, political liberalism, education, and race. The model explains 31% and 26% of the variance for females and males, respectively.
761;1994;This article presents data from the 1990 National Jewish Population Survey (NJPS) on the religious and ethnic patterns of American Jews who were born between 1946 and 1964, the baby boomers. Whenever feasible, the patterns of Jewish baby boomers are compared with those of the broader population of American baby boomers -- for example, by comparing NJPS data with other data sets, such as the General Social Survey (GSS). Jewish baby boomers are also compared Jewish middle agers, those between the ages of 45 and 65. In examining the religious and ethnic patterns of each of the cohorts, a trend of decreased ritual observance and communal affiliation emerges. The long-term significance of such trends remains to be determined.
762;1994;"This experiment tested several hypotheses based on the ""availability hypothesis"" (Spilka et al. 1985), which identifies conditions that impel people to make religious rather than secular attributions. A total of 202 subjects who differed in their adherence to the precepts of conservative Christianity were given a variety of vignettes. Subjects attributed the actions of the central figure in each vignette or the outcome of the vignette to religious causal agents (God, Satan) or secular causes (chance, disposition, or situational factors). In general, secular attributions were invoked much more often than religious attributions. However, subjects' invocation of religious attributions conformed for the most part, to prediction: Attributions to God were more common when the actions or outcomes elicited approval; attributions to Satan were more probable when the actions or outcomes elicited disapproval; attributions to both God and Satan were more prevalent when the attributors were conservative Christians and when the action was linked to religious values. The implications of the experimental findings for the availability hypothesis are considered."
763;1994;"This paper extends Sigelman's (1977) analyses of cross-national patterns in reported levels of church attendance and subscription to selected religious beliefs. The analyses are extended in these ways: More countries are included in the comparisons; more measures of religious involvement are employed; and the data are for about 15 years later, from the same period in the 1980s, for each country. Also, we present multivariate controlled comparisons across nations, which were not provided in Sigelman's analyses. Among the results is evidence that Americans are comparably high, but not always first, in involvement levels, both before and after controls for six sociodemographic status measures. Nation of residence is considerably stronger than each control variable (educational attainment, employment status, age, marital status, community size, and broad categories of religious affiliation) as a predictor, for all of the measures of religious involvement. The different profiles of the nations on the social status controls, and their effects upon involvement, do not explain the cross-national patterns in involvement. Alternative interpretations of the comparative results are discussed."
764;1994;Until now, studies of religious influence on premarital sexual experience have made an implicit assumption that the first occasion of sexual intercourse, whether for males or for females, is consensual. However, recent studies by feminist and other researchers have indicated that at least some degree of coercion is present in a sizeable minority of initial occasions, especially for girls and young women. To the extent that such is the case, religious constraints upon sexual activity cannot be considered relevant for the nonconsenting partner. Failure to take this issue into account has partially undermined the validity of even the most recent studies and might account for some anomalies in those studies.
765;1994;Using data from the 1972-1989 Cumulative Social Surveys, this study tests a hypothesis derived from Berger's (1967) theorizing about plausibility structures. This hypothesis states that among conservative Protestants, education interacts with spouse's religious affiliation to influence religious commitment. As expected, education had stronger negative relationships with several indicators of commitment among conservative Protestants married to people with no religious affiliation than among conservatives married to mainline Protestants or Catholics. Unexpectedly, however, relationships between education and most indicators of commitment were positive among conservatives married to other conservatives, rather than weakly negative. A second hypothesis, which states that among mainline Protestants and Catholics education has a weak effect on commitment and does not interact with spouse's religious affiliation, was generally supported. Theoretical implications of these findings and explanations for why education may strengthen religious commitment among conservative Protestants in homogamous marriages are discussed.
766;1994;"We propose a theory of religious mobilization that accounts for variations in religious participation on the basis of variations in the degree of regulation of religious economies and consequent variations in their levels of religious competition. To account for the apparent ""secularization"" of many European nations, we stress supply-side weaknesses -- inefficient religious organizations within highly regulated religious economies -- rather than a lack of individual religious demand. We test the theory with both quantitative and historical data and, based on the results, suggest that the concept of secularization be dropped for lack of cases to which it could apply."
767;1995;"According to Durkheim, religion provides society with a collective conscience, conferring supernatural validation of the dominant values, norms, and social structure. Winter (1977:27) characterizes this perspective as metaphoric parallelism whereby ""theistic assertions are metaphorical representations of social facts, that is,... there is a parallel between the characteristics attributed to the gods and real properties of the social world."" Durkheim's thesis is tested for parallels between parenting styles reported by children and the images of God held by both generations. Clear evidence was found for parallel between the God-human and parent-child relationships, indicating some degree of congruence between intrafamilial social structure and the images believers hold of the divine. These findings are based on data for more than 3,400 mother-father-youth triads in a nationwide sample of families who completed surveys in 1982-1983 by Search Institute. Support for Durkheim's thesis for this sample of 5th through 9th graders and their parents withstood the introduction of controls for a battery of other relevant influences on God images including social class, age of child, denomination, and church attendance of parents and youth."
768;1995;Although reports of paranormal experiences are well documented, debate continues over the extent to which they are influenced by sociocultural forces. The present study, based on the 1984 General Social Survey, tests whether or not religious orientation, religious behavior, and structural strain predict the odds of reporting telepathic and clairvoyant experiences. The results indicate that more frequent prayer is associated with higher odds of reporting telepathy, and that greater financial dissatisfaction is associated with higher odds of reporting clairvoyance. However, these variables account for little of the influence of several significant demographic predictors. I therefore conclude that although sociocultural forces do affect the reporting of paranormal experiences, further testing must be done in order to determine whether cultural source theories can be extended to explain demographic variation in the reporting of paranormal experiences.
769;1995;Benevolences as a percentage of receipts have declined in many Protestant denominations over the past three decades. To explain the decline, this study develops an economic model of religious congregations and estimates a version of it with data on a national sample of 40 Presbyterian congregations from 1973 to 1988. It is found that per capita county income, membership size, capital expenditures per member, and the poverty rate are statistically significant determinants of per capita receipts and benevolences, although membership size and the poverty rate explain little of the decline in the ratio of benevolences to receipts. Clergy salaries, the relative prices of energy and medical insurance, government transfer payments, and the income tax rate appear to be unrelated to congregational receipts and benevolences.
770;1995;Drawn largely from Stark and Bainbridge's theory of religion, a modified rational choice model of religious behavior is presented and tested using data from the Institute of Statistical Mathematics in Tokyo. It is proposed that such models might perform better in Japan than in the West because of the very practical attitude many Japanese have toward religion, picking and choosing from various religions those rituals and beliefs that seem appropriate for a given occasion. Logistic regression results show that age is associated with an increase in belief in spirits and gods, chronic illness is associated with an increased likelihood of believing in an afterlife, and death of a close relative leads to increased visits to temples to perform rituals but does not lead to an increase in any related beliefs. Also consistent with theoretical expectations, membership in sect-like New Religions is correlated with the absence of a social support network, and belief in good and bad luck as well as membership in a religious sect is strongly associated with a rejection of science as an ideology.
771;1995;"During the nineteenth century, Ireland experienced a ""devotional revolution"" that ensured that Catholic Ireland would become the most ""Romanized"" of all Catholic populations. What most commentators have glossed over is the nature of popular Catholicism in Ireland before the Famine. If pre-Famine popular Catholicism is discussed at all, it is still being interpreted using a ""pagan survivals"" model that has long been displaced in studying popular Catholicism in other areas of Europe. Following the lead of such Italian scholars as Gabriele De Rosa, my concern here is to demonstrate that the pagan survivals hypothesis is less wrong then misdirecting, in that it leads us to focus on what was peripheral rather than central to the experience of popular Catholicism. Irish popular Catholicism was in fact characterized by a set of emphases that were internally consistent but quite different from the emphases characteristic of official Catholicism. These included a strong emphasis upon orderliness and repetition, masculine supernatural beings, and penitential activity, and a lack of emphasis on figurative representation. The article concludes by outlining some obvious next steps that should be taken in investigating popular Catholicism in Ireland."
772;1995;Empirical data from three independently conducted surveys were merged to allow examination of the causal relationships between geographic mobility and religious and ethnic identification among American Jews. The results of ordinary least-squares (OLS) regressions suggest that geographic mobility, after major sociodemographic variables are controlled for, has a statistically significant, albeit slight, effect on the Jewishness score. This finding is further supported by an analysis of variance (ANOVA) The results from this study correspond more closely with the disruption hypothesis rather than with the support hypothesis. The findings show that marital status and place of residence are the two most important variables, accounting for approximately three-quarters of the total variance of the Jewishness score being explained.
773;1995;European immigrant churches had an important role in shaping religion in America. After recent decades of assimilation and acculturation, however, questions arise over whether European ethnicity is a meaningful force in Protestant denominations today. This study explores the continuing influence of Dutch descent in one of America's oldest denominations, the Reformed Church in America (RCA). After a brief background of the RCA, we present survey data that indicate an enduring presence of Dutch heritage among its laity and clergy. When explanations of the persistence of Dutch descent among clergy are examined, social structural factors are found that appear to encourage Dutch clergy to remain in the denomination and to discourage non-Dutch clergy from doing so. The significance of our findings for both the future of the RCA and for the future of ethnic identification for Americans of Dutch descent is discussed.
774;1995;Focusing on institutional legitimation, this study analyzes the abortion policy statements of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops (NCCB) issued in three public fora (general public, Congress, and the Supreme Court) during the time of two landmark cases, Roe (1973-1976) and Webster (1989-1992). The study explores whether the NCCB responds to shifts in the abortion policy environment by varying its self-presentation on abortion generally over time, across specific fora over time, or in response to actual or impending changes in abortion policy within particular time periods. The study found that from Roe to Webster, there was a significant increase in the complexity of the NCCB's general public and legal arguments and a decrease in the complexity of its congressional statements. A significant time-by-forum interaction suggested that fluctuations in the complexity of the Church's arguments were due to the strategic responsiveness of the Church to cyclical shifts in the fortunes of the pro-life agenda.
775;1995;"Gender differences in religiosity are well known. Past studies have consistently shown that females tend to be more religious than males. We propose that gender differences in risk preferences are related to differences in religiosity. Building on the classic concept of ""Pascal's wager,"" we conceive of religious behavior as risk averse and nonreligious behavior as risk taking. Analysis of data from the Monitoring the Future data set shows that the addition of risk preference strongly attenuates gender differences in religiosity. Risk preference also is a significant predictor of religiosity within each gender. Implications of this study are discussed."
776;1995;In the Amazon region, long-standing inequality of social class is exacerbated by the violence and lawlessness characteristic of a frontier area. Peasant farmers often are victimized by violence on the part of wealthy ranchers and land speculators. The strongest voice for the rights of the farmers has been coming from the Roman Catholic Church through two vehicles: the Pastoral Land Commission and base communities. This article, which is based on 107 in-depth interviews conducted in three states in northern Brazil, investigates the means by which these two vehicles have been supported rural mobilization.
777;1995;"In their recent analysis of five counties in North Carolina, Ellison and George (1994) reported a positive association between frequency of church attendance and a variety of social resources. Using the ""Americans' Changing Lives"" data, this study replicates Ellison and George's analysis. The results of this study do not differ substantively from Ellison and George's observations in a southeastern community. In comparison to less frequent churchgoers, attenders report larger networks, more frequent telephone and in-person contacts, and enhanced perceptions of the supportive quality of their relationships. Also, this study finds no evidence to suggest that the observed social resource advantages among frequent attenders are the product of an overrepresentation of extroverted individuals and/or an underrepresentation of more neurotic persons among regular churchgoers. Finally, religious attendance does not appear to be more important to the constitution of individual social resources in the South than elsewhere."
778;1995;Membership levels in Shaker communes and commitment of individual Shakers were subject to religious and other forces. Population data in manuscripts from an autonomous subunit of one Shaker community provide entrance and exit dates and limited information on individual members, and levels of overall population. It is proposed that the Shakers attracted ever less well prepared entrants, and were unable to solve the second-generation problem of convincing young members to persist in the sect. Over time, entrants were ever more likely to have been urban-born, and urban born individuals were more likely to apostatize in the next year than the rural born. The longer members spent in childhood as Shakers the sooner they apostatized. Communities may have acted as a shelter for those especially affected by economic difficulties. Men who joined during recessionary periods were more likely to apostatize soon than those who joined in boom times, and overall levels of population rose in times of economic recession.
779;1995;Of 13 published empirical tests of the proposition that religious pluralism results in higher rates of religious participation, only a study based in the 1851 religious census of England and Wales reported contrary results (Bruce 1992). We therefore subjected these fascinating data to a fuller and more adequate analysis, both statistical and historical. Our results do not replicate those reported by Bruce and are, instead, generally consistent with those of other studies. However, Bruce's paper did prompt us to add a qualifying proposition to our theory of religious mobilization.
780;1995;"Previous exploratory research among Flemish Roman Catholics has shown that church involvement and membership in voluntary organizations have a moderating effect on ethnic prejudice via the negative effect on anomie. This new study with a random sample of 1,650 Flemish Catholics largely confirms previous findings and provides new insights. The moderating effect of church involvement on ethnic prejudice is explained by the negative effect of church involvement on utilitarian individualism and on the feeling of political powerlessness. It is argued that these effects can be ascribed to the humanistic values of ""sociocultural Christianity"" as transmitted by weekly sermons and by the Christian social organizations and schools in Flanders (Belgium). Moreover, social integration into the community counters feelings of powerlessness."
781;1995;Previous research has consistently found that religious individuals tend to be authoritarians and authoritarians tend to be religious. However, in those studies religiousness has been defined and measured within a limited framework which has emphasized orthodoxy and conventionality. Consistent with theorizing in the psychology of religion, we hypothesized a negative association between authoritarianism and religious maturity. As expected, authoritarianism was positively related to several different facets of less mature faith development, and negatively related to several aspects of relatively mature faith development. Our results, which are congruent with the theorizing of Allport and Fowler, suggest that the connection between authoritarianism and religiosity depends strongly on the nature of the religious variables studied. This research should serve to qualify statements about a simple link between religion and authoritarianism.
782;1995;"Religion in the United States is exceptionally vibrant compared to that in other industrialized nations. This research seeks to shed light on this anomaly by comparing measures of religiosity in the U.S. with those of its closest industrialized neighbor, Canada. The comparison demonstrates the effect of America's culture-religion in increasing levels of religiosity through social ""convention."" I argue that religious beliefs and practices are based more on ""conviction"" in Canada, where cultural supports for religion are minimal. Although levels of religiosity are lower in Canada by nearly all measures, comparisons of the pervasiveness and interconnectedness of religious beliefs and practices in the two countries suggest that the differences may be related to culture-religion. Results show that those who rarely attend church in America have higher levels of orthodox religious belief and practice than Canadians who rarely attend. In addition, correlations between measures of commitment are weaker in the United States than in Canada."
783;1995;"Stark and Iannaccone have recently proposed a ""supply-side"" model of religious change and, in applying it to Europe, challenged the previously widely shared view that Britain is now a much less religious society than it was in 1900 or 1800. This reply presents the summaries of the work of a large number of historians of British religion as well as data from recent social surveys and censuses of church attendance to argue that the previous consensus was by and large correct. It challenges Stark and Iannaccone's notion that British lack of enthusiasm for formal religion can be explained by the lack of competing religious organizations."
784;1995;The Branch Davidians were linked to the Seventh-day Adventist Church by their historical roots, the source of their members, their name (officially the Branch Davidian Seventh-day Adventists), their identity, and their apocalyptic preoccupations, idiom, and paranoias. This paper examines the responses within Seventh-day Adventism to the sudden notoriety of the Branch Davidians. In so doing, it sheds new light on the Branch Davidian tragedy: Because Adventist leaders focused on distancing their church from the stigmatized Davidians, the confusion and misconceptions surrounding the latter's practices and apocalyptic theology were not clarified, and information and resources that might have helped government officials play a more constructive role during the siege were withheld. However, the official response was only one of several within Adventism to the Branch Davidian saga. The paper isolates three divergent responses, which are used as a vehicle for exploring long-term trends within Adventism -- its increasing diversity and the strains flowing therefrom. The uncovering of these differing responses opens the way for an investigation of the pattern of diversity that emerges in a sect that is, in the terms of Stark and Bainbridge, reducing its tension with society and moving toward denominational status.
785;1995;"The decline of liberal Protestantism offers an important canvas upon which to portray a myriad of cultural and structural factors at work within religion, on the one hand, and organizations, on the other. Specifically, this paper argues that the decline represents the structural consequence of Protestantism's liberal cultural triumph on behalf of such values as individualism, freedom, pluralism, tolerance, democracy, and intellectual inquiry. As laudable as these values may be from other perspectives, they can be anathema to mobilizing and sustaining any organization that requires a loyal and disciplined membership. The paper puts religious ""strictness"" in a broader perspective and reviews several temporal models that specify the effects more closely. These are all at work within the most recent cycle of liberal cultural assertion followed by membership decline in the 1960s. The paper concludes with some strategic implications for the future as various ""remnants"" seek to stem the tide."
786;1995;"The existing literature on third-party presidential candidacies indicates little to no influence from religious affiliation or practices, in sharp contrast to studies of two-candidate races. Using the National Election Studies of 1968, 1980, and 1992, supplemented by national church census data, we show that the religious roots of major-party voting impede the electoral fortunes of third candidates. Religious adherence in counties is positively related to major-party voting, meaning that third candidates are disadvantaged by the historical connections among denominations, faith, and the two major parties. The individual-level vote choice models indicate that stronger religious beliefs and practices usually have a negative impact on third candidates. Specific denominations rarely correlate with third candidate voting; white southern Evangelicals in 1968 constitute a notable exception. These findings represent extensions of the literature surrounding third candidacies, the structural barriers they face, and the influence of social environments on citizen behavior."
787;1995;The Glock and Stark theoretical framework on Christian beliefs and anti-Semitism implies that orthodox religious beliefs perpetuate secular anti-Semitism via particularism and religious anti-Semitism. Several critics have argued that the major weakness of this study is its failure to examine explanatory variables other than religious beliefs. This paper addresses these issues using data from a 1990-91 national Dutch survey. Although the results tend to support the assumption that nonreligious variables are far more important to the explanation of anti-Semitism and, too, that they attenuate the impact of Christian orthodoxy, the effects of the latter are by no means spurious. The most important conclusion of this paper is therefore that there still is, in Holland at least, a religious factor at work, albeit a modest one, generating anti-Semitic beliefs.
788;1995;The rational choice approach attracts various criticisms, many of them unfounded. This essay defends rational choice as a powerful paradigm for the scientific study of religion. The paradigm unifies a wide range of empirical findings, generates new hypotheses to guide future research, and proves relevant to both contemporary and historical settings.
789;1995;The traditional age-graded, career-stage paradigm used to predict, explain, and evaluate clergy career behavior, has been challenged by the recent substantial influx of ordained second-career men and women. This analysis tests the validity of the paradigm for career trajectories other than those of first-career men. The results, quantitatively evaluating the career trajectories of 1,373 Episcopal and 196 Unitarian Universalist men and women clergy ordained between 1920 and 1990, suggest that the two most relevant age-related demarcations for men are ordination by the mid-thirties for senior-level attainment, and ordination by age 50 for mid-level attainment. Career trajectories of women clergy show fewer age effects, likely due to the suppressing influence of gender on opportunities for mobility and attainment. Consequently, age-graded occupational paradigms are ineffective in explaining or predicting career dynamics for women clergy. Comparison of these two religious organizations suggests that denominational size and occupational structure may influence the effect of age on clergy careers.
790;1995;This article analyzes the long-term impact of the Shiloh Youth Revival Centers, the largest Jesus People movement of the early 1970s, on its former members. It examines the movement's sustained influence on former members who were part of the group's central core of about 5,000 committed individuals. Shiloh engendered a basic change in their priorities and life choices. After the movement collapsed in 1978, Shilohites did not return to the mainline Protestant and Roman Catholic faiths in which most of them were raised. Instead, they entered strict, conservative religions. Although they departed from Shiloh, they did not disengage. Information about the sustained impact of Shiloh suggests the need for more research about the long-term effects of movement membership upon individuals who no longer belong.
791;1995;This article presents a detailed study of denominational retention and switching among American Jews derived from the 1990 national Jewish population survey. Adults report that since childhood the number of Orthodox Jews has decreased by 16%, practically no change has occurred among those preferring the Conservative denomination or without a denominational preference, whereas the number of Reform Jews has increased by 13%. More frequent synagogue attendance, more home religious practices, more involvement in Jewish primary groups, and day-school Jewish education are associated with greater denominational retention. Marriages between Jews and Christians produce shifts to the Reform denomination or, more often, to a no-preference position. Research on denominational shifting needs to differentiate between marriages within or between basic religious groupings.
792;1995;This brief rejoinder to Stark et al. (1995) restates some problems with the identification of pluralism, corrects a misreading of Gill (1992), wonders about the depiction of nineteenth-century Wales, and welcomes an important qualification to the economistic model of religious behavior.
793;1995;This paper presents a theory of serpent-handling sects (SHS) that uses a psychodynamic theory of symbol to complement Sundén's role theory as developed and popularized in America. The legitimization of serpent handling is described in terms of attributions derived from a literal interpretation of the King James Bible. Psychodynamic symbol theory is used to argue for the universality of the serpent as a source of body projections ultimately linked not simply to the phallus, but to death and resurrection. Role theory explains how SHS emerged from the initial actions of a charismatic figure who first acted out repressions symbolized in texts dealing with the serpent. The cultural transmission of serpent handling as a socially constructed religious practice thus builds upon the universal appeal of the serpent base upon body symbolization. Theoretically grounded empirical studies of the differential attraction to and rejection of serpent handling are recommended both to account for the maintenance of this tradition and for its rejection by groups who once supported the practice.
794;1995;This paper uses data from a 1992 survey of young people in Ukraine to examine the linkages among geography, nationality, and religion in Ukraine. Differences in religious interest and affiliation follow distinctive geographic and ethnic patterns, and mirror the divisive voting behavior observed in the 1994 Ukrainian presidential election. Therefore, religious interest and affiliation may play important roles in the developing political divisions within Ukraine. Distinct differences exist in religious interest between western and eastern Ukraine. In addition, religious affiliation differs dramatically along regional and ethnic lines. Western Ukraine contains the highest percentage of religious believers, and these believers are most strongly associated with the Greek Catholic Church. Throughout the rest of Ukraine, interest in religion is lower, and the primary affiliation is with the Orthodox Church. This suggests that religious belief and affiliation may be related to geographic, nationalistic, and political divisions that are currently growing in importance within Ukraine.
795;1995;This study demonstrates that religion is significantly associated with the acquisition of postsecondary education by white women in the contemporary United States. Religion has both direct and indirect effects on educational attainment. Religious traditions differ in the degree to which they emphasize the importance of the family, marriage, and child bearing. This, in turn, influences how much higher education the women of the group are likely to obtain. Thus, religion has an indirect effect on the educational levels of women through their demographic behavior. In addition, we show that there is a relationship between religion and the education of white women that is maintained beyond other sociodemographic factors. A refined model involving 12 religious identifications on a conservative-liberal continuum, subjected to multivariate analyses, illustrates that educational differences tend to be wider among older women. Surprisingly, Conservative Protestant and No Religion adherents do not form the polarities, but have similar middle-order levels of educational attainment.
796;1995;"Those who aspire to engage in the scientific study of religion may, in the course of their research, affect the data that they are studying. The paper examines some ways the study of new religions can result in the researcher's ""making a difference"" for both methodological and ethical or political reasons. A comparison is drawn between the interests of the social scientist and those of the new religions, the anticult movement, the media, the law, and therapists. Finally, it discusses some potential effects on the meta-values of science that may arise out of involvement in the market of competing accounts of new religions."
797;1995;"Transformations within religious institutions and traditions often occur via conflict and internal social movements. Yet previous research on such phenomena has missed some important sociological insights because it has not incorporated methodological and theoretical resources from other sociological literatures dealing with social movements and organizational change and conflict. This paper presents a comprehensive critical review of extant research on intradenominational conflict and identifies and describes five shortcomings in this literature. As a corrective, we suggest that analysts focus on organizations and conflict events as units of analysis, pay more attention to ideal factors in conflict, examine relationships between internal and external variables, and compare conflicts across organizations and across time. These alternative methodological recommendations are related to three new theoretical directions in other sociological subfields: resource mobilization theory's focus on intermediate levels of social life, the ""new institutionalist"" emphasis on how organizational actors respond to their environments, and the recent work on the interplay of ""schemas"" and ""resources"" in social structure. Such new directions address questions that were not accessible via earlier approaches. They also begin to build important bridges between the sociology of religion and other sociological subfields."
798;1995;"Using 1972-1991 GSS data, we create an operational definition of salience of religion and use it to examine church attendance by age and period for two sets of subsamples: Religious Preference Groups (Protestants by gender and race and white Catholics by gender) and Denominational Ideology Groups (white Protestants by gender and religious ideology). We generate three-dimensional age-period-cohort surfaces on church attendance for each group. We find that those for whom religion is salient report weekly attendance and those for whom it is not salient report less than monthly attendance. Among the salient, the pattern of church attendance exhibits no age, period, or cohort effect; among the not salient, variations are linked to age and period across the subgroups. These findings suggest that attendance differences reported by religious preference are largely due to attendance patterns of those least attached to institutional religion."
799;1995;"Using a survey of young adults who grew up Presbyterian, we identified four motivations of people who switched denominations: (1) switch due to interfaith marriage; (2) switch after moving to a different town or neighborhood; (3) switch due to dissatisfaction with one's church; and (4) switch due to personal ties and influences. The third motivation was often associated with a conversion or renewal of commitment. Switches for the first two reasons tended to be within mainline Protestant denominations; switches for the third reason tended to pull a person outside the mainline. Afterward, switchers are more church-involved than nonswitchers, especially type 3."
800;1996;"A growing body of research conducted by cognitive psychologists and behavioral economists finds that some features of human decision making are not adequately described by standard rational choice models of human behavior. In this paper, we offer experimental evidence suggesting that one of these features -- framing effects -- also arises in religious choices. When faced with a hypothetical choice between two religious options, respondents' choices were strongly influenced by the reference point from which they evaluated the options. Such results are difficult to reconcile with standard rational choice models, and they suggest alternatives to extant rational choice explanations of religious behavior. We discuss one such specific alternative: framing effects suggest that a ""status quo bias"" rather than ""religious capital"" may be responsible for relatively low levels of intergenerational mobility among religious denominations."
801;1996;"Although some social scientists see religion as an agent of change, many perceive it as a conservative institution that perpetuates societal norms and values. Many folk religions, however, have properties (e.g., decentralized organizations and unwritten liturgies) that make change easy. Such religions are dynamic and mutable. These properties may even become liabilities by threatening the coherence of belief systems. For example, in the Orisha religion in Trinidad, varied forces are acting to expand the belief system. Perhaps the most significant is that prestige is conferred upon those who are most adept at manipulating the various symbol systems. This has produced an eclectic religion that increasingly confuses worshipers. Some worshipers are responding to this by consolidating the shrines, expurgating ""non-African"" elements, or standardardizing the liturgy. Thus, although religion may be conservative, this quality is not necessarily inherent."
802;1996;Data from the National Survey of Families and Households are used to determine the impact of religion on marital dependency -- the extent to which either spouse believes his or her life would be worse should the marriage end. Spouses belonging to denominations attaching greater value to marriage and marital stability should report greater dependency, as would those who are more involved in the life of the church and those who are married to a spouse of the same denomination. An index of marital dependency is constructed. Religious affiliation increases the likelihood of marital dependency, as does membership in more conservative Protestant denominations and quasi-ethnic religious groups. Church attendance, self-identification as a Fundamentalist and marital homogamy all increase marital dependence. The effect of marital homogamy is stronger among Fundamentalists, even with controls imposed for secular variables, such as labor-force participation, and when the reciprocal effect of the spouse's attitude toward the marriage is taken into account.
803;1996;"Demographic changes in the United States over the past 20 years (i.e., the aging of the baby boomers) should have led to an increase in church attendance. However, church attendance patterns during this period have remained relatively stable. It is suggested that this is only possible if (1) baby boomers are not attending church with greater frequency as they age; (2) age effects are being offset by period effects moving in the opposite direction (a secularization hypothesis); or (3) age effects are being offset through a process of intergenerational exchange whereby younger cohorts throughout their life course attend church less frequently than older cohorts. These three possibilities are tested using Bayesian cohort analysis and the General Social Survey data set. Results support the third explanation. The gains associated with the aging of the baby boomers appear to be primarily offset by cohort effects. Specifically, pre-WWII cohorts attend church far more frequently than post-WWII cohorts. Therefore, as members of these older cohorts die and are replaced by younger cohorts, church attendance decreases, thereby offsetting any gains in attendance associated with the shifting age structure of the U.S. population."
804;1996;Durkheimian theory posits a thin line between civil religion and public education. Indeed, Durkheim thought the two were intimately related in modern societies. This article examines the premises of school desegregation as a healing ritual meant to cure the evils wrought by U.S. apartheid. Within the logic of Progressive Education, the idea was to ritually integrate the schools as a miniature melting pot. Operating both symbolically and as a social change agent, the cure would heal America. Meanwhile the policy's assimilationist assumptions discounted U.S. black culture as championed by W. E. B. DuBois. Research on its mixed effects and a new call for multiculturalism have undermined the Progressivist premises of desegregation. Public education's current confused state mirrors larger patterns of mythic struggle within U.S. society.
805;1996;"Following traditions established by Melville J. Herskovits and Roger Bastide, the literature on African-American religions emphasizes accommodation, acculturation, and syncretism at the level of culture, without adequate attention to the role of individual decision making in religious change. As a result, many anthropological studies stress the adaptability of religious systems but pay scant attention to the limits of religious accommodation. Using examples including Spiritual Baptism and its ""mourning ceremony,"" this paper shows that Afro-Caribbean religion is highly adaptable but not infinitely so. Throughout the New World, however, the degree of African religious tradition preserved during the Diaspora varies widely and is a matter of lively concern to adherents. Edward Sapir's contrast between ""genuine"" and ""spurious"" culture is especially useful in understanding the issues of origin, acculturation and authenticity now important to Afro-Caribbean religious believers as well as to scholars."
806;1996;"In modern American society, the judicial system can be shown to be involved in remaking -- or, perhaps better, redefining -- the sacred. This has become especially apparent since the two conscientious objection cases in 1965 and 1970, in which the U.S. Supreme Court granted conscientious objector status to avowedly nonreligious persons. ""Conscience"" has become in the eyes of the law, then, the equivalent of ""religion."" In matters of free exercise, this has meant a broadening of the sacred realm. In matters dealing with the Establishment Clause, however, the realm of the sacred is actually being redefined. How this happens generally is first analyzed, then three illustrations -- of abortion, euthanasia, and homosexuality -- are offered."
807;1996;"In this paper we demonstrate the various logical and interpretive problems that arise when switching is measured using the respondent's father's religion as a ""proxy"" for the respondent's childhood religious preference. Using ""father as proxy"" results in an underestimation of disaffiliation, an exaggeration of the amount of movement from nonaffiliation to affiliation, and an overstatement of net gains through switching for most denominational families. ""Intergenerational switching"" does not seem to measure switching at all. Instead, much of what is taken for ""switching"" reflects long-standing religious differences between the respondent and his or her father. Since religious preference is a form of self-identity, the most appropriate methodologies allow respondents to self-identify as switchers."
808;1996;"In this paper, we analyze the rationales of antiabortion activists, or ""rescuers,"" in the pro-life movement in a large Midwestern city, and we attempt to explain variation in the unconventional protest activities of such people. We find no differences between rescuers with either pragmatic or purist orientations, but we find that conviction experiences help predict the number of rescuers in which an individual activist will engage. We also find that protesters who give instrumental meanings to their activism are much more likely to participate in frequent sit-ins than those who attach a primarily symbolic meaning to their protests."
809;1996;"Previous studies of the relationship between religion and environmentalism have suffered the lack of measures of religious beliefs or of environmental attitudes and behaviors, or samples that were not clearly representative or sufficiently large. We address these problems using data from the 1993 General Social Survey, which has over 40 measures of environmental attitudes and actions, as well as a large number of measures of religious membership, belief, and participation and other background measures. We focus on 10 indexes of environmentalism and 3 indexes of religiosity. Our findings give some support to the thesis of Lynn White that Christian theology has an ""antienvironmental"" effect, and they do not support the contention that it has a ""stewardship"" effect. There are, however, complications. We do find evidence of a ""proenvironmental"" effect of religious participation. Further, the negative effect of Christian ""theology"" seems to be largely an effect of fundamentalism or sectarianism. While this could be theologically oriented, it might also be an offshoot of conflict between religious conservatives and liberals."
810;1996;Scholars broadly agree that no persuasive general theory of religion exists. Recently, however, new efforts at producing one have appeared. These range from wishful-thinking theories to rationalist and linguistic ones, but they increasingly emphasize cognition. This paper reviews several current approaches and summarizes my own cognitive theory: that religion is a form of anthropomorphism. Earlier writers who have seen anthropomorphism as basic to religion have disagreed about its nature and causes. Most explain it as comforting or as extending what we know to what we do not. Neither explanation is sound. Instead, anthropomorphism stems from a necessary perceptual strategy: facing an uncertain world, we interpret ambiguous phenomena as what concerns us most. That usually is living things, especially humans. Thus we see the world as more humanlike than it is. Religions, this paper holds, are systems of thought and action building in large measure upon this powerful, pervasive, and involuntary tendency.
811;1996;Several recent studies suggest that in analyzing the effects of religion on the economic and demographic behavior of families, attention should be paid not only to the wife's affiliation but also to the husband's. The present paper synthesizes this research: it reviews the mechanisms through which differences between the spouses' affiliations influence marital stability, female employment, and fertility, as well as the empirical findings on these relationships. It also provides additional evidence on the linkage between the religious composition of unions and fertility behavior, based on data from the 1987-88 National Survey of Families and Households.
812;1996;Studies of church growth have fallen prey to numerous statistical pitfalls. Flawed methods and inadequate data have reduced the predictive power of past research while systematically biasing its results. The biases work to overstate the importance of the demographic context in which a church exists and understate the importance of the church's own institutional characteristics, such as organizational strictness. This paper uses theory, simulations, and data reanalysis to explore the empirical difficulties confronting church growth research and to reassess the role of strictness.
813;1996;The number of Catholic nuns has been declining in the United States and other Western nations for 25 years. We argue that the decrease in the number of nuns has resulted (in part) from a particular form of secularization that pertains to social structural changes in substantially industrialized nations, by which the expansion of educational and occupational opportunities for women reduces the attractiveness of Catholic orders as avenues for social mobility. Using a sample of 50 nations, and a measure of the change in the ratio of nuns to Catholic population between 1960 and 1990, our findings indicate that among nations exceeding the 1960 median in economic development, but not the lesser developed ones, the percentage of employed women working in professional and managerial jobs in 1960 (occupational opportunity) is highly related to the dependent variable. The findings concerning tertiary educational rates for women in 1960 (educational opportunity) are weak but in the predicted direction.
814;1996;The theoretical and empirical foundations of secularization theory have come under increasing criticism in the past decade. The paradigm remains generally accepted, however, for the nations of Fennoscandia, where modernization seems to have coincided with a deep decline in religious belief. Using a case study of two religious movements in northwestern Denmark, this paper contests the validity of the secularization thesis in the region that still serves as its type case. It traces the movements from their origins in a nineteenth-century awakening to the early 1990s. This history has not involved the sorts of oppositions between religion and science which are implicit in secularization theory. The secularization approach therefore has difficulty accounting for the patterns of the movements' development. A focus on religion as a system for defining identity and community accounts better for the data, and also resolves some of the theoretical weaknesses of secularization theory.
815;1996;This article explores the relationships between Conservative Protestantism, corporal punishment, and the physical abuse of children. Although recent studies demonstrate that Conservative Protestant parents endorse corporal punishment more strongly and use it more frequently than other parents, it remains unclear whether this form of religious conservatism is linked with child abuse (as that term is conventionally understood). The article examines widespread arguments that corporal punishment per se is harmful to children, with attention to an array of conceptual and empirical ambiguities in the social and behavioral science literature on this topic. The differing presuppositions about families, children, and child rearing that often separate the opponents and defenders of corporal punishment are also discussed. The remainder of the paper outlines several promising avenues for further research aimed at gauging the potential danger (if any) posed by the advocacy and use of corporal punishment by Conservative Protestants and other parents, concluding with a call for civility as well as analytical specificity.
816;1996;"This experiment extends the growing literature aimed at identifying the conditions that impel people to make religious attributions. A total of 177 subjects were presented a series of 16 vignettes after each of which they provided an attributional analysis. The event depicted in each vignette was either (a) an action or occurrence having (b) a positive or negative outcome that was (c) life-altering or non-life-altering. Subjects selected their attributions from a menu that included religious causal agents (God, Satan), several naturalistic causes (e.g., the protagonist's characteristics, other actors), and nonreligious-supernaturalistic causes (fate, luck). As predicted, attributions to God were most commonly made when the event was a life-altering occurrence having positive consequences. Attributions to Satan, rarely made, were prompted by life-altering events having negative consequences. As for whether subjects exhibited a ""God-of-the-gaps"" pattern of causal reasoning, the evidence was mixed but tended to support the conclusion that they did not."
817;1996;"This paper is a study of Santeria, a religion that developed in Cuba from the sixteenth to the nineteenth centuries as a syncretism of African religions, Roman Catholicism, and French spiritism. Still an important religious influence in Cuba today, its beliefs and practices have diffused to many other countries including the United States. The argument presented in the paper is that Santeria can be understood as a ""textual"" rewriting and rereading of the biographies, the histories, and the social contexts of its adherents. Using the oppositional, revisionary, and subversive hermeneutical principles inherited as part of their West African cultural heritage, the creators and followers of Santeria developed their religion as a counterhegemonic challenge to the social, economic, and political order that controlled their lives."
818;1996;"This paper refutes Stark and Iannaccone's recent argument about secularization in Europe as applied to the Netherlands. Relevant Dutch evidence shows that both organized religion and subjective religiosity have declined in the Netherlands since the 1950s. Any deregulation and increases in pluralism that occurred in that period did not have the theoretically expected effects. The anomalous Dutch case casts further doubt on the explanatory power of ""supply-side"" theories in the sociology of religion."
819;1996;This paper reports that the manifestations of Catholic identity among undergraduates at a private, nondenominational, northeastern university replicate the patterns of communal loyalty evident for Catholics as a whole. The study focuses on the ways in which church attendance differentiates moral and sociopolitical attitudes and values, and also examines whether gender is a significant source of cultural variation. The data used in the analyses are based on a self-administered mail questionnaire sent to a representative random sample of the student population. The findings show that all Catholic respondents are selective in their acceptance of church authority. Regular church attenders, nevertheless, are significantly more likely than less frequent attenders to endorse the Church's teaching on sexual morality, and to identify the influence of their Catholic upbringing.
820;1996;This research focuses on the role of women in preserving crypto-Jewish culture in twentieth-century American society. The study of crypto-Judaism refers to a hidden form of religious practice that originated in Spain with the forced conversion of Jews to Christianity beginning in the fourteenth century. Today what remains of this culture can be found in both Latin America and the southwestern United States. Using ethnographic methodology, this work examines the ways in which ritual and secrecy have been maintained by Latina descendants of crypto-Jewish families living in the American Southwest.
821;1996;This study examined how social desirability and religious fundamentalism may moderate relationships between religious orientation and measures of psychological and spiritual health. Intrinsics scored higher on fundamentalism but were not susceptible to a social desirability response bias. In multiple regression equations, intrinsic religion emerged as the strongest predictor of psychospiritual health. Fundamentalism added little or no variance in predicting psychological or spiritual well-being. Quest yielded negative correlations with social desirability and fundamentalism. High quest scorers also reported more personal distress and lower spiritual well-being. Social extrinsicness (Es) was unrelated to psychological or spiritual health whereas personal extrinsicness (Ep) predicted higher personal distress when social desirability and fundamentalism were controlled. Ep was also associated with a satisfying relationship with God but was unrelated to a sense of life satisfaction. With the exception of the extrinsic subscales, all religious measures exhibited good psychometric qualities. Ep and Es suffered from weak internal consistency.
822;1996;This study examines the relationship between socioeconomic attainment and expressions of American Jewish identification in 1970 and 1990. It challenges the conventional sociological perspective that equates socioeconomic success with ethnic assimilation and examines the importance of structural factors in maintaining ethnic identity. Data are drawn from the 1970 and 1990 National Jewish Population Surveys (NJPS). Multiple regression results indicate that exceptional socioeconomic achievements may be directly linked to the changing nature of Judaism in contemporary America. While high socioeconomic attainment is incompatible with the more private, devotional aspects of Jewish identification, higher levels of education and income are associated with a discernible increase in organizational and communal expressions of Jewish involvement. These findings suggest that the Jews' exceptional socioeconomic achievements bind them together and sustain ethnic continuity.
823;1996;This study explores the ability of variations in the natural environment to predict variations in the religious-ethical views espoused by different cultural groups. Drawing from the theoretical perspectives of William James and Max Weber, it was hypothesized that societies with environmental conditions of potentially life-jeopardizing water scarcity would be significantly more likely to show an elective affinity for a morally concerned Supreme Deity in order to promote the prosocial use of natural resources and contribute to societal survival. To test this hypothesis, a worldwide survey was conducted by using the 186 cultural groups in the Standard Cross-Cultural Sample. After the influence of missionization was controlled for, the findings confirmed that in societies with a marginally sufficient water supply, a Supreme Deity was significantly more likely to be understood as concerned with, and supportive of, human morality. In contrast, in societies in which water was abundant, the Supreme Deity typically was not concerned with the morality of human behavior. These findings have implications for developing more fruitful understandings of religious environmental ethics.
824;1996;This study explores the effects of a Christian identity on self-reported dissonance, and the relationship between source of dissonance and its resolution. One hundred sixty-three self-identified lesbians drawn from a convenience sample provided responses to open-ended questions regarding tension between religious beliefs and homosexuality. Source of dissonance was coded as internal, external, or nonexistent. An evangelical identity predicted both internal and external dissonance, although the likelihood of experiencing internal dissonance was higher. Resolution strategies included altering one's religious beliefs, leaving the church, or living with the dissonance. Respondents experiencing internal dissonance were more likely to alter their beliefs. However, the effects of the age of Christian identification and age of first suspecting one's lesbianism suggest that identity synthesis may forestall dissonance resolution when the source of tension is perceived as external.
825;1996;This study investigated race differences in religious involvement across several national probability samples. It employed various measures of religious involvement, and controlled for key sociodemographic variables. The findings reveal that African Americans exhibit higher levels of religious participation than do whites regardless of sample or measures.
826;1996;"This study tests the Stark-Bainbridge theory of sect and cult affiliation (1987) using a sample of 12,415 subjects from the National Survey of Families and Households. Polytomous logistic regression was used to determined the log odds of cult, sect, and church affiliation versus no religious preference. Independent variables drawn from the Stark-Bainbridge theory included education, stake in conformity, ""turning points,"" and the strength of conventional religious organizations in the subject's area. With some exceptions, the results supported the Stark-Bainbridge theory. As predicted, low stakes in conformity increased the log odds of membership in cults and sects. Each year of additional educational attainment increased the log odds of cult membership and decreased the log odds of sect and church membership, as predicted. Furthermore, the strength of conventional religious organizations in the subject's area increased the log odds of sect and church membership as predicted."
827;1996;Through an analysis of national survey data, we test several hypotheses regarding the extent to which the religiously orthodox constitute a monolithic conservative front. We find that the orthodox generally are conservative on social issues of sexuality, reproduction, and schooling of children, but are moderate or liberal on gender, racial, and economic issues. There is little tendency for the orthodox to cohere around a single ideological position or, as individuals, to take stances that are consistent across a broad range of issues. The religiously orthodox are also internally divided on many social and economic issues along the lines of race, sex, class, and age. We suggest that these factors may explain the weak support that the religiously orthodox historically have given to organized political movements of the Religious Right.
828;1996;We lack knowledge on factors intervening between religion and abortion attitudes. Consequently, how religion is associated with abortion attitudes, the full impact of religion, and the most important dimension of religion are all uncertain. Informed by theoretical considerations, I test the plausibility that worldview dimensions serve as intervening factors. Additional hypotheses are also made. All hypotheses are evaluated using General Social Survey data. The findings indicate that worldviews serve as a vital link between religion and abortion attitudes. Moreover, previous work has seriously underestimated the influence of religion, and the degree to which beliefs and decisions are transcendently focused is religion's most central dimension in shaping abortion attitudes.
829;1996;"While empirical studies of religion's involvement in political life abound, there remains a great deal of fuzziness about the concepts that best capture it. Two often-used approaches are ""religion as culture"" and ""religion as ideology."" In some perspectives culture and ideology are treated as mutually exclusive modes of religio-political phenomena; in other perspectives the two concepts are conflated. This article argues for an analytic distinction between culture and ideology that still preserves their interactive and often complementary natures. Examples from empirical studies of religion in politics demonstrate the different ways in which religion acts as a political resource, and the usefulness of the proposed analytic distinction."
830;1996;Women of all ages typically outscore men on most measures of religiousness (e.g., Benson 1991). However, most religious systems are patriarchal in belief and practice, and, as such, could be inhospitable to women. To explore this apparent paradox, sixty-one women between the ages of 18 and 71 were interviewed about their past and present religious beliefs and practices, and how these affected the way they felt about themselves. If their beliefs or practices had changed, they were asked what they felt had contributed to those changes. Open-ended questions and a relaxed format were used to encourage in-depth responses that might reflect each woman's personal perspective. Transcripts of the interviews were analyzed for perceptions of religious inequality, coping strategies, and themes of relationship vs. individuation (Gilligan 1982). Most of the women did perceive inequality but coped with it by cognitive restructuring. Themes of relationship were far more prevalent than themes of individuation, suggesting that women are willing to cope with inequality in part because it is peripheral to their faith experience.
831;1997;"According to its critics, the ""old"" secularization paradigm has been tried, convicted, and executed by recent scholarship in the social sciences of religion, and is being replaced by a ""new"" (postsecularization) paradigm which highlights the continued vitality of religion in modern societies. This paper argues that claims to have definitively refuted secularization theory are exaggerated. It mounts a defense of a ""neosecularization"" paradigm which retains the core insights of the old paradigm while incorporating criticisms leveled against the hubris and laziness of some deployments of the concept of ""secularization."" Following Chaves (1994), this paper argues that the core of neosecularization theory is the proposition that secularization means not the decline of religion but the declining scope of religious authority at the individual, organizational, and societal levels of analysis. Three exemplars of this perspective in the area of religion and politics are highlighted: the work of Hertzke (1988), Demerath and Williams (1992), and Casanova (1994)."
832;1997;Although doctoral programs in clinical psychology seeking to integrate the perspectives of Christian faith have existed for over 30 years, and newer integrative programs continue to proliferate in recent years, no empirical study has examined how such integration actually occurs in these programs, according to the students themselves. Multidimensional scaling of 48 doctoral students' perceptions of 19 full- and part-time faculty members at an APA-approved program in clinical psychology yielded 3 latent dimensions, 2 of which correlated with students' assessment of how exemplary and helpful the faculty were (p < .05). Recent confluence of contemporary psychoanalysis and attachment theory indicates that attachments need not be renounced in the name of maturity, and serve vital developmental needs throughout adulthood. Canonical correlation of the 3 latent dimensions with attachment-related criterion variables suggests that students may use faculty as subsidiary attachment figures or transitional objects, particularly the professor's own ongoing life of faith, to facilitate students' integrative pilgrimage.  Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, 1997.
833;1997;"Christian schools of the conservative variety are providing a breeding ground for a degree of ecumenism, or at least a kind of ""generic"" panconservative Christianity, with some of the corners of historical doctrinal differences rounded down. During an eighteen-month-long participant observation study of schools sponsored by fundamentalist, evangelical, pentecostal, and charismatic churches -- representing all strands of conservative Christianity -- the author found that doctrinal differences among the conservative Christian churches did not predict the modes of operation in the schools they supported. Factors which have influenced this outcome are discussed. Implications for the future of denominationalism and for the place of conservative Christianity in American Public life are pondered."
834;1997;Conflicts over women's ordination have occurred within U.S. religious denominations for over a century. The nature of those conflicts, however, has changed over time in very substantial ways. Using systematic data and illustrative material from 15 conflicts occurring since 1920, we argue that the most recent of several shifts in the nature of conflicts over women's ordination occurred circa 1970. We identify four ways in which post-1970 women's ordination conflicts differed from pre-1970 conflicts: (1) The frequency with which the conflicts occurred among denominations increased. (2) The organizational location of those most prominently advocating women's ordination shifted from the organizational elite to the grass roots. (3) Women's ordination advocates more frequently used extrainstitutional tactics in pursuit of their goals. (4) Organized opposition to women's ordination became more common. We argue that these changes in women's ordination conflicts were largely produced by changes in the social and cultural context, especially the rise of second-wave feminism and the associated influx of women into divinity schools and seminaries.  Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, 1997.
835;1997;"Do variations in religious orientation make a difference for the programs and policies of international relief and development organizations? We analyze data on 63 American religiously based organizations and denominational agencies that provide emergency relief and long-term economic development services to people and communities in other countries. We find that differences in religious tradition make very little difference in the size of programs or in the actual program activities. The most significant difference between religious traditions is in how they publicly legitimate their activity to their constituents. For example, analysis of mission statements and program descriptions indicates that, in the explicit justifications for their activities, evangelical groups face different ideological tasks than mainline Protestant and ecumenical organizations. More subtle legitimations occur in how tasks are defined in organizational structure and budget accounting categories. Here, mainline Protestant and ecumenical groups are the most likely to draw sharp distinctions between ""religious"" church extension programs and ""secular"" relief and development activity, while evangelical organizations are more likely to blur such boundaries."
836;1997;Four years after responding to a newspaper survey on attachment and close relationships, 146 women completed a follow-up survey on changes in their religious belief and experience during the interim period. Logistic regression analyses were used to predict Time 2 religion variables prospectively from adult attachment styles as measured at Time 1, statistically controlling for Time 1 religious commitment. Insecure-avoidant and insecure-anxious women, as measured at Time 1, were more likely than secure women to report having found a new relationship with God in the subsequent four-year period, and insecure-anxious women were more likely than both other groups to report a religious experience or conversion during that period. Results are interpreted in terms of religious beliefs serving a compensatory role for individuals lacking secure interpersonal attachments.
837;1997;"How do children's perceptions of parents relate to their perceptions of God? Two samples of children ages 4 through 11 (N = 49 and 94) indicated their perceptions of parents' and God's nurturance and power and reported on discipline in the home. Despite differences between the two samples in race, socioeconomic status, and religious affiliations, remarkably consistent findings were demonstrated. When parents were perceived as nurturing and powerful (especially when mother was perceived as powerful and father was perceived as nurturing), children perceived God as both nurturing and powerful; more like father in early childhood and more like mother or both parents in middle childhood. God seems to become the perfect ""substitute attachment figure"" as children separate from parents with age, or when fathers are absent from the home. Girls' images were more related to parents' attributes and discipline styles than were boys' God-images. In childhood, it is parents who directly and indirectly impact God-images."
838;1997;"Iannaccone (1994) proposed that church success results from controlling the free-rider problem and that churches with few free-riders are more likely to provide collective rewards. Using a sample of ""Middletown"" residents (N = 567), we tested hypotheses derived from Iannaccone's theory. Our critical variable was respondents' estimates of the number of free-riders in their churches. We found some evidence consistent with the idea that church success is negatively related to the number of free-riders, but the results were not statistically significant; moreover Catholicism seems to have more free-riders than would be predicted by Iannaccone's theory. The number of free-riders was not related to two collective rewards measured in this study: the absence of noninvolved people at church services and participation in supportive church groups."
839;1997;In a study that used Hermans's (1987, 1988) valuation procedure, 40 participants each provided a highly valued experience of four types: science, religion, interpersonal and intrapersonal conflict between science and religion. They then rated these valuations on 30 affect terms, some of which were later organized into categories: Positive, Negative, Self, and Other. Participants also filled out questionnaires that were used to categorize them as low or high in scientific and religious orientation. Typical valuations of participants in these four science and religion categories are presented as qualitative idiographic information. In addition, quantitative analyses of affect ratings are presented as nomothetic information. Generally, affect ratings of scientific experiences were more Self-directed while religious experience valuations involved equally high levels of Self and Other affect. Both scientific and religious experiences were evaluated as having Positive but not Negative affect. Interpersonal and intrapersonal conflict were experienced as more Self-directed than Other-oriented. While interpersonal conflicts displayed more Negative affect than Positive, intrapersonal conflict was evaluated equally on these two measures.
840;1997;In this paper, I hypothesize and show evidence for a causal link between local land use systems and popular receptivity to ascetic, rationalist religions in sixteenth-century Germany, France, the Netherlands, and England. Rationalist religions typically received popular support in regions characterized by individual property rights in land and little communal control over agriculture. I argue that this social organization of agriculture gave rise to individualistic value systems, which had an affinity with rationalist, ascetic belief systems.
841;1997;"It is likely that ""Homo sapiens"" practiced shamanic healing for many millennia. Studies within anthropology, folklore, hypnosis, medical history, psychoneuroimmunology, and religion support the argument that suggestions embedded within shamanic rituals have therapeutic effects. Shamanic/hypnotic suggestions may reduce pain, enhance healing, control blood loss, facilitate childbirth, and alleviate psychological disorders. Those more responsive to such suggestions are hypothesized to have a survival advantage over the less susceptible. As a consequence, shamanic rituals selected for genotypes associated with hypnotizability, a trait correlated with frequency of anomalous and religious experiences. With the evolution of psychophysiological structures associated with hypnotizability, modern forms of religious sentiment became possible."
842;1997;"Many observers have been perplexed by the sudden membership drop in Catholic religious orders following Vatican II reforms. They are faced with the paradox that increasing individual liberties and decreasing communal demands have been associated with membership declines. Using a recent survey of religious orders, I find strong support for the thesis that ""when religious orders limit nongroup activities (by supporting the traditional demands of membership) they are more successful in recruiting new members"". But the thesis does not suggest that support for traditional demands stifles innovation or change. I use the activities of recently formed religious orders to illustrate how religious movements make innovative returns to tradition."
843;1997;Martin Offenbacher's statistical study comparing the school enrollment of German Protestants to Catholics plays a significant role in the articulation of the Weber and Merton theses. The current study provides an overdue correction of obvious flaws in Offenbacher's data. There follows a subsequent reassessment of that recalculated data indicating a now diminished difference between Catholic and Protestant school 'preference.' Any remaining disparity between the denominations' school 'choice' is seen here as attributable to operative practical factors as opposed to Weber's and Merlon's long-standing attribution to differing religious values. The paper argues more generally that the theoretical appeal enjoyed by the conceptually linked Weber and Merton theses in sociology may have invited the all too facile acceptance of idealist interpretation at the expense of practical factors in explanations for discrete denominational behaviors.  Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, 1997.
844;1997;Previous research indicates the importance of the religious market theory in explaining cross-national differences in secularization. In this article, religious market variables are compared with indices of modernization and culture in explaining differences in religious mentality and religious activity. Data from the 1990 European Values Survey for 16 countries are used. In general, culture and modernization are more important than the religious market structure. Although church membership is explained by the religious market structure, the effects are opposed to the expectations. Of the modernization and cultural indices, development of welfare state and masculinity/femininity appear to be the most relevant characteristics. Of the market variables, level of state regulation is more important than religious pluralism.
845;1997;"Religious partipation is far lower in most western European nations than in the United States. Most European social scientists believe this is a demand-side phenomenon in that Europeans no longer find religion plausible. But, recently some American social scientists have defined it as a supply-side phenomenon -- that lax and inefficient state-supported European churches suppress participation. A crucial experiment would assess these competing claims by selecting a random sample of Europeans and transporting them to America. Does their religious behavior (and that of their children) became ""Americanized"" as they are exposed to a vigorous supply-side? In this paper I approximate such an experiment by comparing the religiousness of first-, second-, and third-generation German Americans with their German ""cousins."" The results very strongly support the supply-side explanation."
846;1997;Research is just beginning to appear about the effects of Soviet repression on the churches and religious beliefs of the countries which constituted the former Soviet Union. Data from an opinion survey conducted in 17 countries of Western and Eastern Europe in 1991 allow some preliminary observations of a baseline nature about church membership and religious values in these countries. In this paper I compare church membership and religious belief across age categories among Western and Eastern Germans, Hungarians, and Poles. The data show variant patterns of religious affiliation and belief among each of the churches of Central Europe. State repression of churches has substantially affected church membership in Eastern Germany. There is some evidence of a secularization effect among Hungarian Protestants. Polish church membership has been less negatively affected by the years of communism. Mean levels of religious belief for each of these countries show further evidence of these country-specific patterns. Further research is needed to uncover the longer lasting trends in religious affiliation and belief in these countries.
847;1997;Researchers frequently postulate a strong relationship between religiosity and marital stability. We incorporate a multidimensional specification of religiosity into event-history models of the religion-marital stability relationship. Results are based on panel data from the National Survey of Families and Households (N = 4,587 married couples). While no single dimension of religiosity adequately describes the effect of religious experience on marital stability, the frequency of religious attendance has the greatest positive impact on marital stability. When both spouses attend church regularly, the couple has the lowest risk of divorce. Spouse differences in church attendance increase the risk of dissolution. All significant religious affiliation influences disappear once demographic characteristics are controlled. The wife's religious beliefs concerning marital commitment and nonmarital sex are more important to the stability of the marriage than the husband's beliefs.
848;1997;"Since January 20, 1994, the Toronto Airport Christian Fellowship, a church located near the Pearson International Airport, has become the center of a global revival. Although similar revival fires are underway at other centers (in various parts of North America as well as on other continents), TACF is an important institutional source for the dissemination of the experience, ideology, and structural form of this religious social movement. Using a Weberian theoretical framework based on Thomas O'Dea's ""institutional dilemmas,"" this descriptive account of the ""Toronto Blessing"" provides a first-hand portrayal of the process through which charisma becomes routinized. Each of O'Dea's five dilemmas is discussed, noting the balance between charismatic manifestations and institutional features set into place by TACF leadership. The dynamic interplay between charisma and institutions is illustrated through teachings, testimonies, and observations made during 22 months of field research."
849;1997;Studies indicate that religious affiliation has a significant effect on political and social attitudes in the United States. A conservative-liberal continuum exists among religious groups, with certain Protestant groups demonstrating relatively consistent conservative, moderate, and liberal attitudes toward several issues. Moreover, Catholics tend to report moderate attitudes, with Jews and nonaffiliates reporting the most liberal positions. However, research that has delineated this continuum has not examined changes over time. This paper examines two competing viewpoints, which we label convergence and divergence, that are derived primarily from contemporary theories of religious change, with 20 years of data from the General Social Survey, to examine whether attitudes regarding several relevant issues have shifted significantly both between and within religious groups. We find that a within-group convergence of attitudes has occurred for issues such as women's roles in society and marijuana use, divergence between groups but convergence within groups has occurred for abortion attitudes, and a clear divergent pattern has emerged between conservative Protestants and other groups in attitudes toward school prayer. Inter- and intragroup changes over time vary from issue to issue and suggest that a complex interplay of religious and secular forces have affected changing attitudes among religious adherents.
850;1997;"Studies of secular occupations have suggested that sharp influxes of women, producing a demographic ""feminization,"" result in negative occupational effects that serve to reduce rather than enhance women's opportunities and attainment. Occupational feminization of the clergy has become a likely prospect in many denominations, as increasing concentrations of ordained women interact with ongoing retirements that are mostly male. In this study, the career trajectories, of 1,373 Episcopal and 196 Unitarian Universalist female and male clergy ordained between 1920 and 1990 were compared using quantitative techniques. Clergy feminization trends tended to concur with those found in secular occupations. The results point to a persistent gender gap in attainment for Episcopal priests, and to a direct relationship between the increase in women ordained annually and the emergence of occupational effects that serve to suppress or segregate women's labor into lower-level attainment patterns in both denominations.

851;1997;"The present study attempts to measure how individuals define the terms religiousness and spirituality, to measure how individuals define their own religiousness and spirituality, and to examine whether these definitions are associated with different demographic, religio/spiritual, and psychosocial variables. The complete sample of 346 individuals was composed of 11 groups of participants drawn from a wide range of religious backgrounds. Analyses were conducted to compare participants' self-rated religiousness and spirituality, to correlate self-rated religiousness and spirituality with the predictor variables, and to use the predictor variables to distinguish between participants who described themselves as ""spiritual and religious"" from those who identified themselves as ""spiritual but not religious."" A content analysis of participants' definitions of religiousness and spirituality was also performed. The results suggest several points of convergence and divergence between the constructs religiousness and spirituality. The theoretical, empirical, and practical implications of these results for the scientific study of religion are discussed.  Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, 1997."
852;1997;The psychology of religion always having to orient itself toward a more general psychology and its object being very diverse, the branch of human science called hermeneutical psychology is suggested as the most appropriate and viable to study religiosity. After emphasizing that the subdiscipline's object is a culturally constituted phenomenon to be understood by psychology in a historical perspective, special attention is given to the historical variant of cultural psychology. Three subvariants and their relation to the psychology of religion are pointed out. Psychohistory is presented both as an example of an older inclination within the psychology of religion to take the historical-cultural embeddedness of religious phenomena into account, and as an advanced possibility for conducting interdisciplinary research.
853;1997;The willingness of seminarians to subjugate their personal views to church teachings is a key component of church renewal and change. The complex web of causes and effects surrounding seminarians' willingness to subjugate themselves to church teachings renders bivariate investigations incapable of determining the strengths of the numerous possible causal connections. We disentangle these effects by testing a structural equation model based on data from 203 Catholic seminarians about their sexual orientation, their willingness to subjugate themselves to the church, and their acceptance of traditional teachings. The model fits the data well and provides the surprising conclusion that only a few of the postulated effects are operative. Sexual orientation has no appreciable impact on willingness to subjugate oneself to church teachings, and no impact on whether the seminarians support a reform role for the church. The more the seminarians view their faith as mystical, and the more strongly they agree that Jesus Christ is God humbled, the more they are prompted to subjugate their personal views to church teachings. Having ever loved someone makes seminarians less willing to subjugate themselves, and progression through seminary training reduces seminarians' willingness to subjugate themselves.
854;1997;"Theoretical paradigms that have called attention to the contemporary ""war"" over the family suggest that religious conservatives in general, and evangelical Protestants in particular, are among the most vociferous defenders of a ""traditional"" patriarchal family structure. However, a handful of recent inquiries on contemporary evangelical spousal roles has suggested that conservative Protestants are not unanimous in their support for a patriarchal family structure. Drawing on insights from poststructuralist theories of discourse and gender theory, this study augments such investigations by analyzing the rhetoric contained within a large sample of popular evangelical family manuals. I demonstrate that leading conservative Protestants are engaged in a rancorous debate about spousal authority relations, with evangelical purveyors of patriarchy attracting significant criticism from prominent biblical feminists and a growing coterie of egalitarian evangelical commentators. After delineating the most salient points of this internecine debate, I trace these antagonists' divergent recommendations for the allocation of spousal authority to their distinctive assumptions about (1) the nature of masculinity and femininity, and (2) Bible's instructions for familial decision making. I conclude by specifying several directions for future empirical research, and by explicating this study's challenge to prevailing assumptions concerning the religious contours of the war over the family."
855;1997;This article examines the demographic characteristics and political attitudes and behaviors of Nicaraguan evangelicals, Roman Catholics, and nonreligious. Analysis of data from a nationally representative 1990 Gallup survey -- conducted shortly after the national election in which the revolutionary FSLN was swept from power by the opposition -- shows that Nicaraguan evangelicals were stronger supporters of the leftist Sandinistas than was the Catholic majority. These findings challenge the conventional wisdom of earlier literature that Latin American evangelicals are inherently apolitical, other-worldly, or right-wing. These findings underscore the theoretical importance of accounting for prevailing political opportunity structures and social class interests in understanding the varied political commitments and behaviors of Latin American evangelicals.
856;1997;This paper examines sex differences in the transition rate of clergy from seminary graduation to parish employment. It investigates how different temporal frameworks: - the evolution of the women's movement, the organizational histories of denominations, and the timing of career decisions in the life course - affect the transition rate for men and women, net of statue attainment factors. Analyses show that while it still takes women 33% longer to find their first job, gender differences have decreased across cohorts, even in a contracting labor market. Surprisingly, neither age nor career switching has adverse effects on the transition from seminary to parish employment. Analyses suggest that the entry of women into the labor market may stimulate the formalization of employment procedures, which creates benefits for both men and women.  Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, 1997.
857;1997;This paper explores the determinants of religious giving through simulations, economic theory, and survey data. Skewness, a distinctive yet poorly understood feature of religious giving, proves to be an inevitable consequence of the weak correlation between absolute levels of income and percentage rates of giving. The weak correlation can be derived, in turn, from a formal, rational choice model of religious participation. Data from the General Social Surveys show that this model also accounts for many other observed patterns in giving and church attendance.
858;1997;"This paper exposes a serious shortcoming in the methods by which social scientists typically analyze the relationship between formal education and religious belief. Those who think about this relationship commonly imagine its producing quite disparate patterns of effect. Two of the most prominent of these are characterized by the contrary images of ""erosion"" and ""fissure."" The problem is that conventional statistical techniques are generally ill-suited to distinguishing between these disparate effect patterns, and so I propose a method of logit modeling that is better able to do so. I illustrate and prove the utility of this method using data drawn from the 1988 and 1993 General Social Surveys."
859;1997;"This paper intersects two recent trends in social movement research: rediscovery of the centrality of both ideology and religion to understanding social movements. Using two recent national surveys, we assess the extent to which three religious beliefs and one religiously linked belief are related to ideological support for the animal rights movement in the general public. Among both women and men, the belief that God is in nature and a religiously linked opposition to science facilitate support for animal rights, counter-acting the negative impact of greater church attendance. However, biblical literalism and a ""gracious"" image of God have little effect on acceptance of animal rights. We conclude by considering implications of these results for subsequent research on religion and ideological support for social movements."
860;1997;This study examines the interactions between an imported religious health code and local medicinal concepts among members of a Latter-day Saints congregation in Antigua, Guatemala. It challenges David Martin's assertion that if any of the rapidly growing religious groups originating in North America is engaged in the (North) Americanization of Latins, then the Mormons would be that group. Based upon ethnographic interviews with active and inactive converts to Mormonism, the data suggest that Guatemalan interpretations of the LDS health code are influenced by both local concepts of hot/cold medicine and North American interpretations promoted by missionaries and church leaders. These findings indicate that conversion is always two-sided and that one should expect to find variation among religious practitioners from separate cultures even within a single multinational religious body.
861;1997;This study investigated the role of religious coping among 150 family members of homicide victims. Six types of religious coping activities were examined: Spiritually Based Coping, Religious Support, Avoidance, Pleading, Good Deeds, and Discontent. We hypothesized that high levels of religious coping would be reported by the sample and that religious coping generally would be related to less posthomicide distress. Results indicated that the sample engaged in high amounts of religious coping activities, with the exception of Discontent. Contrary to hypothesis, religious coping activities largely were related to more distress. Whereas Religious Support was positively related to well-being, Pleading, Deeds, and Discontent were related negatively. These findings suggest that although religious coping activities are prevalent among homicide survivors, these activities may be related to poorer mental health outcomes when coping with loss of a family member to homicide.
862;1997;"This study of 724 adolescents from four public high schools indicated that any relationship between religion and delinquency is complex. Indeed, it indicates that the significance of the relationship depends on what measures of religion are used, on whether other important familial and peer influences are considered, and on the form of delinquency analyzed. When only controlling for demographics, while examining measures of church attendance and religiosity, the present study supports the usual conclusion that religion is related to status offenses and not to crime (see reviews, Burkett 1993; Cochran et al. 1994). However, evangelism is not related to either form of delinquency when only considering the effects of demographic variables. On the other hand, when elements of control theory were added to demographic factors with hierarchical regression procedures, church attendance and religiosity ceased to be relevant to status offenses and remained irrelevant to crime, whereas evangelism was related to crime. The implications of those findings for future investigations were discussed."
863;1997;To enhance psychological adjustment, Vipassana meditation assists individuals to perceive the transitory nature of the self. Because the consequences of this potentially troubling insight are not well understood, changes in self-concept and ego defense mechanisms of two cohorts (N1=222, N2=216) of young (M = 18.03 years) Thai participants who attended separate seven-day Vipassana meditation retreats and a nontreated control group (N = 281) were compared. Multivariate statistical analysis revealed positive gains in all areas of self-representation among meditators relative to controls (p < .001). Ego defense mechanisms of the meditation participants also underwent significant change (p < .0001) with coping becoming characterized by greater maturity and tolerance of common stressors. Increases in Buddhist beliefs were significantly correlated with heightened self-esteem and less impulsiveness (ps < .001). Theoretical and applied implications of the findings are discussed.
864;1997;"Two studies assessed how people's religious orientation and their endorsement of right-wing authoritarian attitudes are linked to the kinds of goals they establish for their children, and their approval of corporal punishment. In Study 1, a survey of 204 undergraduate students revealed that their religious fundamentalism was linked indirectly to greater emphasis on obedience in a hypothetical child-rearing situation through the desire to keep their children in their religious faith; and to greater approval of corporal punishment through greater valuation of obedience. In Study 2, 83 mothers and 71 fathers of university students responded to a questionnaire designed to examine the hypotheses that while parents' religious fundamentalism would be negatively related to their endorsement of child autonomy, it would be positively linked to stronger desires to keep children in their religious faith, to greater emphasis on obedience and to greater approval of corporal punishment in child-rearing. Also, it was expected that parents' right-wing authoritarian attitudes would be linked to their fundamentalist religious orientation, as well as to greater emphasis on obedience and approval of corporal punishment. Results from the zero-order correlations were in keeping with the hypotheses. However, a mediation (regression) analysis indicated that parents' right-wing authoritarianism was a better predictor of their child-rearing attitudes than was religious fundamentalism. Fundamentalism, however, proved important in predicting parents' goal of socializing their children to accept their religious faith.  Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, 1997."
865;1997;"Using contemporary and historical data on religion in Canada, the article argues that recent rational choice/religious market theories as represented especially by Stark, Finke, and Iannaccone are both useful and limited. Competition among Christian denominations was indeed instrumental in the nineteenth-century ""churching"" of Canada, but this victory of voluntaristic and evangelical/devotional denominationalism brought about deregulation, not the other way around. The development also supports the secularization thesis in that denominationalism was a response to structural secularization. The decline of liberal Protestant and Catholic denominations in Canada after 1960 is then analyzed as the decline of denominationalism in a changed post-World War II atmosphere, and not necessarily the secularization of these same denominations. ""Supply-side"" explanations of the same decline are criticized as inadequate because they cannot account for the timing of the decline or the relative failure of other providers to ""re-church"" the leavers. Secularization theory is criticized for not leaving sufficient room for the possible maintenance of religious influence under conditions of structural secularization."
866;1997;"We begin by developing arguments linking aspects of Conservative Protestant theology with attitudes toward family planning. We then develop a theoretical model, and test hypotheses distilled from this model using data on a sample of Protestant seminary students (base N = 635) drawn in 1995-96. As expected, seminarians from Conservative Protestant denominations are less supportive of family planning than their mainline counterparts, although respondents in both groups express broadly favorable views of family planning. This observed denominational pattern is accounted for by the disproportionate tendency of fundamentalist and evangelical students to view the Bible as the inerrant Word of God. In turn, the strong relationship between inerrancy and family planning attitudes seems to reflect the inclination of inerrantists: (a) to interpret a key fertility-related passage, Gen. 1:28a, as a command and/or a blessing from God directed at individuals and couples; and (b) to harbor more conservative attitudes regarding human sexuality. Several alternative explanations for the denominational variations in family planning attitudes are also explored. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings for future research on Conservative Protestant attitudinal distinctiveness, and on the links between religion and health issues.

867;1997;We examine behaviors involved in family worship, how these behaviors cluster together into specific patterns of family worship, and how these patterns of family worship relate to the behaviors and beliefs of adolescents attending Seventh-day Adventist schools. Seven patterns of family worship were detected by cluster analysis of questionnaires completed by 7,658 Seventh-day Adventist youth, grades 6 through 12. Worship patterns that actively involved youth in reading, praying, and sharing their religious experience were rated as more meaningful and interesting and were associated with higher levels of Active Faith (a factor score). Youth in families with worship patterns that did not actively involve the youth were even lower on Active Faith than youth whose families had no worship. However, No Worship youth were highest on Materialism/Legalism and Alcohol/Drug Use. With one exception, worship patterns with high youth involvement were associated with lower Alcohol/Drug Use and lower Materialism/Legalism. Youth in the Shared Worship group, in which every family member participated in every phase of worship every day, were high on Active Faith but also relatively high on Materialism/Legalism, and Alcohol/Drug use suggesting a pattern of compulsive behavior.
868;1997;While many of the studies of Korean Christian churches in the United States mention the presence of cell groups within the churches, little scholarly research exists on the structure and functions of the cell group ministry. Based on data from a large Korean Christian Church in Houston, Texas, the structure of the cell group ministry is described in ethnographic detail. Four major functions that the cell groups provide for both Korean immigrant newcomers and established Korean residents are described, with emphasis upon the mutual benefits that exist between cell groups and Korean entrepreneurs. The paper concludes with the delineation of organizational problems that may also result from a strong cell ministry.
869;1997;Women who entered Master of Divinity programs leading toward ordination in the 1970s were part of the first generation of women to enter Protestant ministry in large numbers. Utilizing a framework suggested by the work of Everett Hughes on contradictions and dilemmas of status, this paper examines these women's experience of going first, of combining gender and work in a new way, particularly in settings of congregational ministry. The analysis is longitudinal, based on interviews in the 1970s with a sample of 30 women then enrolled in a United Methodist and a Lutheran seminary in the United States, and on interviews with the same sample of women 15 years later.

870;1998;"""Religion"" has been distinguished from ""magic"" for the solidarity ties allegedly offered by the former, but not the latter, which by contrast is claimed to emphasize individual needs. However, the contemporary ""alternative"" or ""countercultural"" spiritual network (e.g., New Age, Neo-Paganism) utilizes beliefs and practices that could be described as magic, while still offering social solidarity. Excerpts from in-depth interviews with 22 alternative spiritualists illustrate how the strain between individuality and community is addressed. Shared ideology across individuals suggests that alternative spirituality is a contemporary social movement, in which protest against social control is voiced more through communication codes than overt political action. Thus, expression of individuality paradoxically becomes a source of solidarity. This movement reflects large-scale tensions in complex societies regarding individuality versus community. Therefore, ""magic,"" when enacted in a complex society, deals with many of the same social strains as religion or other social institutions.  Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, 1998."
871;1998;A 1993 study of Assemblies of God, Baptists, Catholics, Lutherans, and Presbyterians inquired about levels of volunteering by parishioners to support church programs. About half of church members volunteer for their churches. Levels of volunteering to support church programs are higher in conservative and evangelical churches, while volunteering for community programs is higher in mainline Protestant churches. The value of volunteers to most churches is roughly two-fifths the value of their monetary contributions. Volunteers' value is highest among Lutherans and Baptists - almost half the current amount of monetary contributions.  Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, 1998.
872;1998;"A small number of researchers and social commentators have called attention to negative perceptions about voodoo in U.S. cultural discourse. Yet, remarkably little scholarship has examined the nature, scope, and source of these perceptions in a systematic fashion. In this paper, I use key insights from social constructionism to examine three different typifications of voodoo as broadcast by the U.S. news media. I begin by outlining the constructionist perspective, focusing most pointedly on the nature of claims-making and its relationship to typifications (i.e., distinctive constructions) of a social problem. Then, I examine in detail three specific typifications of voodoo as promulgated by various sets of primary and secondary claims-makers in recent years. These respective typifications portray voodoo as (1) a religion based on black magic and witchcraft; (2) a melange of superstitious beliefs used for deceptive purposes; and, (3) a cult religion which sanctions human torture and sacrifice. I conclude by discussing the implications of my findings for claims-making and media representations about unconventional religious groups.  Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, 1998."
873;1998;"Although many studies of physical, emotional, and social effects of sexual abuse have been conducted, spiritual effects have received little attention. Using Mormon women (Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints) who had received counseling, this exploratory study compared 115 women who reported having been sexually abused as children with 70 who reported no such abuse. The questionnaire probed their concept of God, measured by Gorsuch and Spilka's Adjective Scales; sense of spiritual well-being, measured by Paloutzian and Ellison's Spiritual Well-Being Scale (SWBS); and overall optimism or pessimism, measured by Seligman's Attributional Style Questionnaire (ASQ). In all three areas, the sexually abused group's scores were significantly more negative than were the scores of the nonabused group. This strongly suggests the relevance of spiritual issues in the treatment of survivors of child sexual abuse.  Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, 1998."
874;1998;"Americans vary widely in their ideas about causes of and solutions to poverty, and differ as well in what compassion to the poor should look like. Few researchers have examined the complex issue of compassion. Most who have suggest that conservative Protestantism has lagged behind Catholicism and more liberal Protestantism in ""generosity"" or ""commitment"" to the poor. This article examines the giving habits of Americans to organizations which help the poor and needy, using religious and political measures to test the conventional view that devout Catholics and liberal Protestants are the ""friends of the poor,"" and that politically conservative Christians are indifferent or hostile toward them. The results suggest that religion and religiosity do increase giving to the poor, but that there is no support for the conventional wisdom about conservative Protestants. Indeed, the evidence suggests theological and political conservatives are currently more generous in this particular form of charitable giving.  Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, 1998."
875;1998;"Among the processes most thoroughly analyzed by social scientists studying religion have been conversion/affiliation and, more recently, deconversion/disaffiliation (Snow and Machalek 1984; Bromley 1991). Recent theory and research on these processes have been stimulated by a variety of developments, such as the historic, absolute decline in mainline church membership coupled with an unanticipated surge in conservative church membership, a mass exodus from traditional religious orders, the rapid growth and subsequent decline of controversial new religious movements, and widespread experimentation with a diverse array of New Age and quasi-religious groups. The primary focus of research has been on the nature of individual transformation and the process by which it occurs, which has concentrated theory and research at a microsocial level. Indeed, in assessing recent theory and research on conversion, Machalek and Snow (1993: 69) observe that ""it is somewhat ironic that sociologists have shown little reluctance to subordinate social contextual variables to individual variables in their efforts to explain the causes of conversion"" and call for a shift in analytic focus ""to the role of temporal, organizational and macrosocial factors."" The same observation can be made about deconversion/disaffiliation. In fairness, there is a long history in sociology of analyzing ""role types"" that emerge in specific social contexts (Klapp 1954), and there have been some attempts to create types of conversion/affiliation (Lofland and Skonovd 1981) and deconversion/disaffiliation (Richardson et al. 1986) in a manner that potentially would link role and organization structure. The exit typology developed here and applied to religious organizations constitutes an effort to connect that social process and its accompanying interpretive narrative to organizational context.1 I argue that the process of exit and the way that it is interpreted is significantly determined by the power and social location of the organization from which exit occurs. Specifically, I begin by specifying three types of organizations in contemporary American society based on level of tension with the surrounding environment - Allegiant, Contestant, and Subversive - and three corresponding types of exit characteristic of these organizational forms - Defector, Whistle-blower, and Apostate.2 The form of exit analyzed here is not the typical leavetaking that occurs in organizations of all kinds. Rather, I examine cases where exiting is contested. But these are particularly significant events because they reveal the capacity of organizations to exert power when it is in their interest to do so. I employ a variety of illustrative cases of exit to articulate the way in which the position of the organization in the social order influences the way that the exit process is structured.

876;1998;"As part of a larger inquiry into the consequences of international migration for those who remain in the country of origin, detailed interviews were conducted with 234 adults in four Turkish provinces. Three migrant-status categories were defined: (a) Returned migrants, (b) Nonmigrant close kin or friends of migrants, and, as a control group, (c) All others. With respect to religious observance and adherence to religiously based viewpoints, group (a) was the least ""traditional,"" and group (c) the most ""traditional."" In between was group (b). Of the two possible explanations for such a pattern - recruitment and socialization - recruitment appeared highly significant. The evidence for socialization, however, was mixed. General social change, not migration as such, would appear to be the more likely factor to move individuals' religious observance and attitudes along a ""traditional""/""non-traditional"" continuum.

877;1998;As previously found, three styles of religious problem solving were hypothesized. In a sample of 272 male clergy and spouses, factor analysis was used to assess the dimensionality of the Religious Problem-Solving Scale using a short form consisting of 18 of the original 36 items. Factor analysis pointed to a three-factor solution with six items each loading on each factor corresponding to three styles of religious problem solving. These three styles suggest a manner of problem solving in which the individual is in a partnership with God in coping (Collaborative), one in which the individual assumes total responsibility for problem solving (Self-Directing), and one in which the individual abandons responsibility for problem solving, leaving it up to God (Deferring). The study also found high internal consistency among the items forming the three subscales. The study substantiates three distinct scales of religious problem solving and supports a fuller consideration of the religiosity variable in problem solving and coping for clergy. The value of parsimony in scale design or usage in research is implied.  Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, 1998.
878;1998;Data drawn from a well-known survey of 2,667 registered U.S. Catholic parishioners (part of the Notre Dame Study of Catholic Parish Life) were used to examine the ways in which black Catholics differ from white Catholics in the patterns - and predictors - of religious devotionalism and spirituality. Black Catholics were found to display higher levels of the more private styles of religious devotion and report a greater frequency of spiritual experiences than white Catholics. Especially interesting are the high rates of participation by black Catholics in a variety of traditional, uniquely Catholic styles of devotion. Contrary to expectations, the correlates of religiosity for black and white Catholics tend to be similar. For both groups, social network variables are the strongest net predictors of every measure of religiosity.  Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, 1998.
879;1998;"Different aspects of religiosity have been found to be positively related to physical, psychological and social well-being. Several scholars have suggested that religious beliefs, religious communities, and perceived divine support may provide individuals with a sense of coherence, which in turn has positive effects on individual well-being. This ""coherence hypothesis"" is in fact the inverse of the Durkheimian concept of anomie. This paper specifies and tests a structural model of social control, social support, religious participation, religious orthodoxy, and perceived divine support, in relation to perceived exteriority and constraint among adolescents. The results indicate that parental support and religious participation increases the perceived exteriority and constraint of the social world, while parental rule setting, religious orthodoxy, and divine support do not have an independent effect.

880;1998;"In a recent challenge to the view that New Religious Movements (NRMs) are uniformly patriarchal, Palmer (1993, 1994) has brought forward the Brahma Kumaris (BKs) as an extreme countercase. Research presented here confirms her characterization of the BK gender ideology as one of ""reverse sex polarity"" (casting females as spiritually superior to males) and thereby partially validates her ""unsuspected gender role variety"" thesis, but shows that this is not associated in Western contexts with an ""overwhelmingly female"" leadership, as she claimed. Further, Palmer's thesis that groups with ""reverse sex polarity"" models will necessarily have predominantly female memberships is invalidated by findings on Western BKs. Nonetheless, data on attrition rates of Australian BKs in this study show that Palmer need not have taken the Brahma Kumaris as exceptions to her characterization of Western NRMs as settings for gender role experimentation.

881;1998;"National and regional surveys that have included items on healing suggest that a significant minority of Americans claim to have experienced a divine or miraculous healing. Many of them are involved in a Pentecostal or charismatic (P/c) approach to Christianity, a recent offspring of which is the 'Toronto Blessing,' a modern revival having its origins at the Toronto Airport Christian Fellowship. P/c Christians promote a worldview in which the power of God freely moves through and among believers and in which healing is regarded as ""supernaturally natural."" Using a model implicit in McGuire's qualitative research on P/c healing as a framework for multivariate analysis, the effects of ritual participation, physical manifestations, and emotional responses on four types of healing are explored in a sample of 918 Toronto pilgrims.

882;1998;Previous research on the explanation of moral attitudes has been restricted to individual characteristics of the respondents. In this article we take account of the trivial fact that respondents are surrounded by people in their primary networks who may affect their moral attitudes as well. The crucial question then becomes: Which individual characteristics affect one's moral attitudes, respectively, which characteristics of people belonging to the individual's network (spouse, parents, and parents-in-law) affect the individual's more attitudes? We perform multivariate (LISREL) analyses, using national family data representative of the Dutch population. In line with previous research we find that the effects of individual religious characteristics (religious involvement and religious beliefs) outweigh the effects of other characteristics (educational level and personal income) on the respondent's moral attitudes. Moreover, we find additional direct effects of spousal characteristics on the respondent's moral attitudes. These findings indicate that people in the respondent's networks contribute to the explanation of one's attitudes on moral issues.  Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, 1998.
883;1998;Private religious consumption has been neglected by most prior research and theory examining religious markets. This article begins an initial assessment of how private religious consumption operates. We investigate private religious behavior among African Americans, to see if these individual religious activities respond to preferences and social contexts in the same way as public religious expressions. Our findings indicate that individuals' religious preferences are not as important for predicting prayer, watching religious television and listening to religious radio broadcasts, or reading religious literature in the rural South. We conclude that the semi-involuntary nature of religious behavior for African Americans in the South - and especially the rural South - extends to private religious actions. Further, in contrast to both the decline of denominationalism thesis and speculation about the monolithic nature of the black church, we show that denominational ties influence private religious behavior.

884;1998;"Recent developments in the sociology of religion have suggested that a new approach, or ""paradigm,"" is guiding research in the sociology of religion, and is gaining empirical support. This new approach has as its core proposition the notion that competition between religious denominations has a positive effect on religious involvement, and, conversely, that religious monopolies tend to inhibit personal religiosity. This study attempts to apply this general hypothesis to the nations of Western Europe, and to extend the range of dependent variables to which the pluralist program can be applied. We generally find strong support for the new research program, in that Catholics in primarily Protestant countries exhibit higher levels of religious observance than do Catholics in countries with Catholic majorities, as well as greater adherence to Catholic social teaching.

885;1998;"Recent work calls attention to religious globalization - the proliferation of transnational religious structures and movements that challenge the nation state. But contemporary migration prompts a different type of religious transnationalism that has not been sufficiently explored. Sustained connections between communities of origin and destination give rise to a set of transnationalized institutional relationships, discourses, and practices that globalize everyday religious life at the local level. This articles aims to contribute to a more systematic understanding of local-level religious globalization by exploring the case of Catholic church ties spanning Boston and the Dominican Republic. It also stresses the importance of taking into account sustained homeland attachments in understanding everyday immigrant religious life. Strong ties between migrants and nonmigrants created a transnational religious sphere within which people, resources, and social remittances were constantly exchanged. Religious life in Boston and the Dominican Republic were reciprocally transformed as a result. Subsequent emigres continue to infuse fresh ""Dominicanness"" into the Boston church, though it is a ""Dominicanness"" that is increasingly pan-Latino in tone. In this way, transnational ties reinforce religious pluralism at the same time that they limit its scope.  Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, 1998."
886;1998;Recently, scholars have argued that divisions have emerged within many countries between tendencies toward orthodoxy or fundamentalism on the one hand, and progressivism or modernism on the other hand. In the present study, interviews assessing moral evaluation and reasoning were carried out with individuals in India and the United States who might be expected to tend toward orthodoxy and progressivism (N = 80, ages 35-55). In both countries, progressivists reasoned more in terms of Shweder's (1990) Ethic of Autonomy than orthodox participants, whereas orthodox participants reasoned more in terms of the Ethic of Divinity than progressivists. However, cross-cultural differences were also found. Progressivist Americans more than progressivist Indians tended toward hyperindividualism.  Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, 1998.
887;1998;Religious conflicts were explored in a sample of 202 adulte, 132 of whom provided written descriptions of conflicts they considered to be religious in nature. The majority of conflicts involved other people, but the resolution of the conflict did not. Participants also completed Hunt's Lateral, Antiliteral and Mythological scales of religiousness. Mythological scores were significantly greater among people who had experienced conflict than among those who had not. No reliable differences in Literal and Antiliteral scores were observed between participants who have experienced religious conflict and those who have not.

888;1998;"Research in the area of Afro-Latin religions has traditionally viewed Cuban Santera, Haitian Vodun and Puerto Rican Spiritualism as unrelated. Common methodological problems in the consideration of syncretism have contributed to a Eurocentric belief that the sole mediators of the enslaved were the institutions wielding hegemony. This article includes a review of both historical and contemporary research. Prior research on Afro-Latin religions is viewed as Eurocentric and as tending toward deforming the image of Africans in the New World. There is also an analysis of Santera, as La Regla de Ocha is popularly known in Cuba; of La Religin Lucum, as Santera practitioners prefer being called in the United States and of Haitian Vodun. Puerto Rican Spiritualism is discussed and comparisons are made with other Afro-Latin religions. A critique of syncretism as a deterministic tool is provided from a multicultural-Afrocentric viewpoint Gender restrictions and the issues of sexual preferences within the religions are also discussed. A multilingual bibliography is also included.  Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, 1998."
889;1998;Research on denominational affiliation and its influence on individual attitudes has increased recently due to widespread interest in whether the United States has become increasingly polarized on a variety of divisive social issues, even while demographic differences among denominations have decreased. However, recent empirical research has, in general, failed to support a polarization argument. Using 22 years of data from the General Social Surveys, we analyze changes over time in the relative variability and distribution of attitudes toward family issues (abortion, gender roles, and sexual behavior) within denominational groups after controlling for the effects of demographic covariates and church attendance. The results show that adjusted coefficients of variation and kurtoses have changed inconsistently. For example, although there has been a decreasing trend in relative variation about women's roles and premarital sex, measures of kurtosis fail to indicate a flattening or peaking of the distributions among denominational groups. However, attitudes toward abortion among conservative and moderate Protestants have become relatively more variable and have moved in the direction of bimodality as gauged by decreasing kurtoses. Similarly, moderate Protestants show increasing relative variability and movement toward bimodality with regard to attitudes toward homosexual relations. These results indicate that, except for a couple of notable examples, attitudes among members of denominational groups have not generally become more polarized over time.

890;1998;Researchers have consistently found that blacks are more opposed to legalizing voluntary euthanasia than are whites. Although sketchy and untested, theories for this race difference attribute it either to a difference between the two groups' levels of fundamentalism, or to a difference between the two groups' levels of fear regarding of giving others the power to end one's life. Data from the General Social Survey (GSS) and the Ohio Death and Dying Survey (DANDS) are used to examine to what extent these two variables, along with socioeconomic status and political conservatism, account for blacks' greater opposition toward legalizing voluntary euthanasia. An exploratory structural equation model of attitudes toward physician-assisted suicide, though based on limited data, suggests that all four variables are important in explaining the difference between blacks' and whites' attitudes toward legalizing voluntary euthanasia.

891;1998;Scholars such as Ebersole and Wald have explained American Jews' overall liberalism using theories of social standing. This article extends social-standing theory to include all religious minorities, two additional countries, and a particular policy issue - immigrant rights. If our extended social-standing theory is correct, we would expect native religious minorities to support immigrant rights more than the religious majority does. Indeed, multivariate analysis confirms this hypothesis. In the United States and France, belonging to a religious minority (e.g., Jews and Catholics in the United States, Protestants and the non-religious in France) appears to increase one's support for pro-immigrant policies. Since Catholics and mainline Protestants were equally divided in West Germany, however, being Catholic in this third country did not affect attitudes toward immigrant rights. This solidarity-of-the-minorities effect also occurs independently of subjective religious commitment.  Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, 1998.
892;1998;Seventy, predominately inner-city, minority women who had been sexually assaulted in the previous 9 to 24 months filled out a questionnaire that included measures of change in well-being and change in the role of spirituality in their lives since the assault. Sixty percent of the victims indicated an increased role for spirituality. Changes in spirituality correlated .54 with changes in well-being. The victims with increased spirituality appeared to have restored well-being, whereas those without increased spirituality continued to have significantly depressed well-being. Although this study cannot provide convincing evidence for the causal mechanisms for these results, a model of compensating reciprocal causation between spirituality and well-being following traumatic events merits further study because it explains both the relatively high correlation in this study and the low correlations in cross-sectional studies of well-being and spirituality. With this model, a traumatic event causes reduced well-being, which causes increased spirituality, which then helps restore well-being to pre-event levels.

893;1998;"Sociologists of religion interested in the possible cultural significance of contemporary new religious movements have tended to focus their analyses on whether these new forms of religious life are or are not agents of modernization and/or secularization. In recent years talk of globalization has been added to these complex concerns. This article outlines the existing debate over the cultural significance of new religious movements (NRMs), and summarizes and criticizes the contribution of globalization theory, as framed by Roland Robertson. Robertson's theory, it is argued, helps to undermine the questionable tendency to identify new religions as either modern or antimodern, secularizing or desecularizing. But it tends to erroneously limit the attribution of cultural significance to movements of religious fundamentalism or renewed orthodoxy. Logically, however, the theory also suggests new ways of attributing cultural significance to more ""privatized"" modes of new religious life like Scientology or the New Age Movement  Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, 1998."
894;1998;"The increasing discussion of ""secularization"" is hampered by several ambiguities. What we need is not some new, academic definition, but to recognize that we already adopt several different meanings for the word, depending on whether we are referring to a society, a population, an institution, an activity, or a mentality. Therefore, treating secularization as a general ""decline of religion"" is hardly meaningful. This recognition will make it possible to make sense of the fact that ""Christianity"" and secularization have sometimes increased together. Finally, the magnitude of the subject is vastly increased when it is viewed from the far side of a historical divide which seems real enough, despite measures of continuing religiosity.  Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, 1998."
895;1998;The present study builds on the emerging body of empirical literature examining religion from a contemporary psychoanalytic perspective that is particularly informed by object relations theory. Such a perspective leads to the hypothesis of a positive relationship between spiritual maturity, defined relationally, and level of object relations development. In other words, it is proposed that the developmental maturity of one's faith and relationship with God is associated with the developmental maturity of one's relationships with others. Spiritual maturity was measured by the Spiritual Assessment Inventory and the Religious Status Inventory. Level of object relations development was measured by the Bell Object Relations Inventory. Results revealed 19 out of 20 significant correlations in the predicted direction between both measures of spiritual maturity and the measure of level of object relations development. Research and clinical implications are discussed.  Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, 1998.
896;1998;The present study investigated the opposing hypotheses, derived from attachment theory, of adult religiousness as compensating for or corresponding to the quality of childhood relationships with parents. Questionnaires containing measures of childhood attachment quality and one's own and parental religiousness were completed by 203 students at Uppsala University, Sweden. The results supported the compensation hypothesis in that insecure respondents, to a larger extent than secure respondents, reported an increase in importance of their religious beliefs during adulthood. In addition, insecure respondents who had experienced low parental religiousness were more religious, were more likely to perceive themselves as having a close relationship with God, expressed more theistic beliefs, and reported a higher level of religious change during adulthood, whereas secure respondents were agnostics to a larger extent. However, if parents had been highly religious, secure respondents generally scored higher on the religiousness variables than insecure respondents, indicating a higher congruence between parents' and respondents' religiousness in the secure groups and also giving support for the correspondence hypothesis. The usefulness of attachment theory for understanding religiousness in comparison to the predominant psychodynamic conceptualizations was discussed, and the question of compensation or correspondence was elaborated.

897;1998;The purpose of this study is examine the relationships between church-based emotional support, negative interaction, and psychological well-being among clergy, elders, and rank-and-file members of the Presbyterian Church USA. Based on identity theory, it is proposed that clergy will receive more emotional support and encounter more negative interaction than others in the church. It is further hypothesized that the impact of emotional support and negative interaction on well-being will be greatest among members of the clergy. Data from a nationwide survey of Presbyterians reveal that elders as well as clergy encounter more emotional support and negative interaction than rank-and-file members. The findings further indicate that the effects of emotional support and negative interaction on well-being are greater for clergy and elders than for rank-and-file members. The implications of these findings are discussed, along with several promising directions for future research.  Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, 1998.
898;1998;"The understanding and interpretation of the presumed ""secularization"" of Britain and other European nations is clouded by a lack of adequate information regarding the substance and timing of religious change. This paper represents the first systematic effort to collect and analyze existing survey data on religious belief in Britain from the late 1930s to the present. Overall, the results show an increase in general scepticism about the existence of God, the related erosion of dominant, traditional Christian beliefs, and the persistence of nontraditional beliefs. A theoretical perspective is needed that recognizes the often corrosive effects of modern life on the transmission of religious beliefs and the continued popularity of worldviews which presume a transcendent referent, however broadly defined.

899;1998;This article examines the relative prominence of religion in the American South, in light of two contemporary phenomena: increased interregional mobility in the United States, and the rise of American evangelicalism. We investigate the effects of regional migration and non-migration on church attendance and importance of faith in the South as compared to the rest of the country. Results show that religiosity increases when people move to a region of high religious commitment, and decreases when one moves to an area where religious commitment is lower. The evidence suggests that the South maintains its religious distinctiveness for natives, but the prospects of maintaining as strong a religiosity for those who migrate out of the South are low. These findings call into question Mark Shibley's thesis (1996) about the sources of the resurgence of American evangelicalism.  Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, 1998.
900;1998;This article explores aspects of Latina culture and how it shapes dimensions of Latina religiosity. This issue is important, because as the authors argue more often Latinas are discussed as victims of their societies and less often as agents of social change. Latinas play central roles in their communities, particularly in the religious cultural sphere where their influence has shaped religious practice and beliefs. We argue that analyzing cultural beliefs and practices are necessary elements of understanding religiosity that have implications for measuring religiosity.  Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, 1998.
901;1998;This article extends the theory of sect development by showing, through comparative analysis, that the development trajectories of foreign mission churches controlled from a national home base are influenced by the trajectories followed by their home religious bodies. It also suggests that the trajectories of mission churches not controlled by home religious bodies are far more responsive to differing local circumstances. In applying church-sect theory, which has typically focused on schismatic groups within a single society, to national branches of international religious bodies imported as a result of missionary activity or migration, the paper demonstrates that the dynamics can be similar in key ways. In doing this, it builds on Bryan Wilson's employment of church-sect theory in his study of nonschismatic new religious movements in developing countries. The data show that the dynamics in the 204 countries where Seventh-day Adventism has been imported are akin to those in the United States, where its origin was schismatic. That is, even though we would expect that Adventism in most of these countries would be highly sectarian since the members there are mostly first-generation converts, this is not so: the churches there, like the American church, are moving from sect toward denomination. However, when Adventists are compared with Jehovah's Winesses and Pentecostals, both of which are also expanding rapidly in developing countries, it is found that the trajectories taken by all three differ considerably. The strength of ties to a global organization proves to be highly significant in accounting for the directions taken. Since the patterns that emerge in the mission churches of hierarchical, centralized groups tend to parallel those set originally in their home bases, the anlaysis allows the prediction of the global profiles which such groups will develop.

902;1998;"This article offers a sociohistorical description of the evolution of Marian devotion after the sixteenth-century rift in Christianity that generated today's Catholicism and Protestantism. The analysis departs from the premise that there were two reformations, each responding to separate socioeconomic conditions. In order to analyze the evolution of Marian devotion, I utilize what I call ""material theology"" in order to measure the mediation of formal theology and popular religion. I show that the printed prayers, books, pictures, statues, and medals produced to accompany Marian devotion also projected specific notions that corresponded to the Ibero-Mediterranean polity of the sixteenth through the first half of the eighteenth century. Utilizing the notion of a ""baroque mentalit"" the ethos of the age is explored for examples of how theology and popular culture intersected. I emphasize that Marian devotion brought universalism to Catholicism, which contrasts with the Eurocentrism of Protestantism at the time. The use of Mary as a symbol of universal Catholic belief was matched with an emphasis upon her appearance and/or miracles in specific locations, especially those in the colonies at the outer reaches of the Ibero-Mediterranean polity. Although this baroque mentalit was superseded by other trends within Catholicism toward the nineteenth century, I conclude that new terminology less dependent on concepts derived from Weber and Durkheim may be required to understand Catholicism of this period and the Marian devotion which animated it.

903;1998;"This article presents a naturalistic study based on analysis of archival and other data of the corporate culture of the Metropolitan Community Church of Austin, Inc., a local congregation associated with the Universal Fellowship of Metropolitan Community Churches (UFMCC). UFMCC is a Christian denomination which has traditionally served a largely homosexual membership. Guided by a definition of essentialism as given by Warner (1995: 97-99) - the right to be who you are - the data suggest that this congregation has used essentialistic means to form a strong sense of self. It has freely relied upon political, social, psychological, and religious approaches and actions to foster its sense of worth. Corporate cultural themes present in the congregation include actions directed at positive identity formation and self-esteem enhancement; study and dissemination of a theology based on historical-critical analysis; religious ceremony, preaching and ministry which recognizes its legitimacy as a Christian church; commitment to social and political actions in terms of human and political rights; fostering of friendship and bonding among members; recognizing and dealing with internal conflict; and development of a sense of historical importance.

904;1998;"This paper applies rational choice theory to the religion of Mother Teresa of Calcutta. Rational choice theory purports to explain individual religious choices, such as conversion and church participation. Yet confirmation of the theory has been invariably quantitative - statistical correlations rather than the close examination of individual religious consumers. How well can rational choice theory account for the religious career of a single person? The authors - one from religious studies and the other from economics - present an interdisciplinary appraisal. Mother Teresa is presented, first, as a consumer of religious commodities and an investor in religious human capital, rationally conducting cost-benefit analyses in order to maximize her utility; and, second, as the owner of a successful religious firm, seeking to maximize profits. An assessment follows of the power of rational choice theory to illuminate her personal saintliness and world-renowned mission to the poor. We conclude that rational choice theory offers a useful addition to the arsenal of analytic approaches to religion.  Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, 1998."
905;1998;This paper examines the compatibility of Islam and the extension of women's rights, one element of democratization, with attention to social complexities within Muslim societies and to religious distinctions within Islam. A random sample of 1,500 Kuwaiti citizens, surveyed in 1994, provided data on individuals' status differences, their religious beliefs and practices and their embeddeness into social networks which are sources of attitude support and formation. OLS regression analysis demonstrated that Islamic orthodoxy was compatible with extending women's rights while Islamic religiosity was not, regardless of the respondents' sects. Respondents occupying positions of social status were more inclusive. However, respondents' ties to the social system around them predicted differently for members of Sunni and Shia sects. Also, intrasect differences probably reflected respondents' connections to different schools of Islamic thought in different geographical locations which hold differing ideas and opinions regarding the place of women.

906;1998;This study attempted to identify positive and negative patterns of religious coping methods, develop a brief measure of these religious coping patterns, and examine their implications for health and adjustment. Through exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, positive and negative religious coping patterns were identified in samples of people coping with the Oklahoma City bombing, college students coping with major life stressors, and elderly hospitalized patients coping with serious medical illnesses. A 14-item measure of positive and negative patterns of religious coping methods (Brief RCOPE) was constructed. The positive pattern consisted of religious forgiveness, seeking spiritual support, collaborative religious coping, spiritual connection, religious purification, and benevolent religious reappraisal. The negative pattern was defined by spiritual discontent, punishing God reappraisals, interpersonal religious discontent, demonic reappraisal, and reappraisal of God's powers. As predicted, people made more use of the positive than the negative religious coping methods. Furthermore, the two patterns had different implications for health and adjustment. The Brief RCOPE offers an efficient, theoretically meaningful way to integrate religious dimensions into models and studies of stress, coping, and health.

907;1998;This study examined the nature of spiritual conversion in a sample of 130 Christian college students. More specifically, this study offered a definition of spiritual conversion and tested it by comparing the ways in which spiritual conversion differs from both gradual increases in religiousness, and from no religious change. Spiritual converts, nonconverts who increased in religiousness gradually, and religious adherents who did not experience religious change were selected using a screening questionnaire. A questionnaire battery was used in the assessment of the research questions, and was supplemented with 10 interviews which provided personal examples of the students' religious experiences. There were significant differences between the religious change groups and the group not experiencing religious change in terms of their pre-change experiences, post-change experiences, and amount of pre-post change. However, the study did not strongly differentiate between spiritual converts and nonconverts who had experienced religious change. The theoretical implications of these results were discussed.

908;1998;This study investigated the clinical utility of the Spiritual Well-Being Scale (SWBS) with psychiatric inpatients. Specific questions addressed were possible ceiling effects in the SWBS for this population and the SWBS's factor structure. Statistical analysis on archival data from 141 female and 61 male (N = 202) patients suggested a lack of significant ceiling effects in the SWBS with this population. Factor analysis, using Direct Obliman rotation, evidenced a three factor solution for this sample. Psychometric issues and clinical utility of the SWBS with this population are discussed.

909;1998;"To meet the rigorous standards set by the social sciences, religious research needs to answer two questions: ""To what degree are constructs developed on spirituality separate and distinct from established psychosocial variables""; and ""To what degree do religious constructs provide insights into human functioning over and above those already provided by existing psychological constructs?"" Addressing these questions, the current study evaluated the relative contributions of Pargament et al.'s (1988) Religious Problem-Solving scale, the NEO-FFI (a measure of the five-factor model of personality; Costa and McCrae 1992) and two measures of environmental stress in predicting burnout among American Baptist clergy on the Maslach Burnout Inventory (Maslach and Jackson 1986). The results indicated that the Religious Problem-Solving scale was a construct relatively distinct from the other psychological constructs. Hierarchical multiple regression results indicated that while the Religious Problem-Solving scale showed incremental significance in predicting burnout over the other psychosocial measures on two of the Maslach Burnout Inventory scales, its contribution was small. A methodology sensitive to the incremental validity question that uses the five-factor model as a point of reference is recommended for future research.

910;1998;Two samples of adolescents, comprising 340 males and 347 females between the ages of 13 and 15 years, and 59 males and 233 females between the ages of 16 and 18 years completed the Bem Sex Role Inventory together with the Francis Scale of Attitude toward Christianity. The vast majority of subjects in both samples were from white Anglo-Saxon backgrounds. Among both age groups, females recorded a more positive attitude toward Christianity than males. At the same time there was a positive correlation between femininity and attitude toward Christianity among both age groups. Multiple regression analysis indicated that among the older group individual differences in gender orientation explained all the variance in attitude toward Christianity between males and females. Among the younger age group, sex still explained additional variance in attitude toward Christianity after taking gender orientation into account.  Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, 1998.
911;1998;When Max Weber propounded his famous Protestant Ethic thesis, he curiously did not examine the impact of Calvinist ethics on the rise of the modern family. The argument developed herein proposes that the same religio-cultural forces which precipitated the takeoff of modern rational capitalism also laid the foundations for the emergence of the modern family by making love between spouses a religious duty and a means for glorifying God. In juxtaposition to Shorter's well-known thesis crediting industrialization as the formative force for the making of the modern family, this paper demonstrates that - prior to the industrial revolution - Calvinist-Puritan movements institutionalized such hallmarks of the modern family as mate selection based on romantic attachment, companionate relations between husband and wife, child-centered nuclear families, and greater equality for women in the familial institution.

912;1998;Whether religion is the opiate of or the inspiration for political activity is one of the classic questions in the study of religion and politics. No place is this more clearly demonstrated than in the study of African Americans and racial empowerment. Despite the close relationship between religion and the Civil Rights Movement, many suggest that the nature of black Protestantism, especially its otherworldly orientation, depresses efforts to maximize African American political and social influence. Examining different components of religiosity among African Americans, this study finds that no form of religiosity depresses racial empowerment, but that varying aspects do have different effects. Organizational religiosity strongly predicts support for integrationist-oriented means to empowerment. Otherworldliness strongly predicts support for separatist-oriented means to empowerment. Religious guidance does not predict support for any aspect of empowerment. The study illustrates the multidimensional nature of religiosity and highlights the complexity of the relationship between religion and politics among blacks.

913;1999;"A ""supply-side"" theory of religion claims that ties between church and state inhibit religious mobilization. The theory also asserts that the weakening of church-state ties is the inevitable harbinger of broad religious pluralism. This paper investigates these claims using the relationship between the state of Utah and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (the ""LDS"" or Mormon church) as a case study. Data demonstrate that the loosening of church-state ties in early Utah coincides with rising rates of religious activity and the emergence of religious pluralism, as supply-side theory predicts. However, these incipient trends were swiftly curtailed by renewed growth within Mormonism, which rebuts the theory's claims. The paper presents several reasons why Mormonism was able to circumvent the predicted effects of religious competition in Utah, and offers these as caveats for supply-side theory.

914;1999;A central debate in the sociology of religion concerns whether religious pluralism enhances or diminishes religious involvement. Contrary to Finke and Stark, much previous research using U.S. counties, both contemporary and historical, finds a negative relationship. However Finke, Guest, and Stark (1996) argue that counties are too large to measure the effects of religious pluralism most relevant to their theories and suggest that if smaller areas such as cities are used, the relationship is positive. Using data from the 1991 Canadian Census we show that the relationship between pluralism and religious affiliation is strongly and consistently negative both for census divisions (counties) and census subdivisions (cities, towns, and townships). We argue that religious pluralism may reduce social reinforcement for religious involvement by reducing the number of close social ties individuals have with others who share a common religious identity.

915;1999;Although scientific and religious perspectives often give different interpretations of physical phenomena, there are indications of a shared concern for understanding human-environment relations. Biological, social, and behavioral sciences provide constructs for a typology to describe and interpret human-environment relations. Using the typology to analyze recent Catholic papal and episcopal documents concerning human-environment relations suggests overlap as well as differences in the use of scientific constructs. The main difference is the relative absence of two biological constructs in the Catholic documents, carrying capacity and population, that may affect possible convergence of scientific and religious environmental understanding.

916;1999;"Are the intrinsically religious less likely to help aperson if that person's behavior violates conventional values? If so, is it because they have antipathy toward the person or toward the behavior? To answer these questions, 90 undergraduates were given the opportunity to help either of two same-sex peers win a monetary prize. About one peer, they knew nothing; from the other, they had received two self-disclosing notes. The first note either did or did not reveal that the discloser was gay; the second revealed that the discloser wanted the money for an activity that either would or would not promote homosexuality. Participants scoring high on measures of devout, intrinsic religion helped the gay discloser less than the non-gay, even when their help would not promote homosexuality. These results suggest that devout, intrinsic religion is associated with antipathy toward value violators, not just toward value-violating acts; it is associated with compassion that is circumscribed, not universal.

917;1999;Christian antihomosexual sentiment was hypothesized to be a function of respondents' Fundamentalist (F) beliefs, low Intrinsic (I) and high Extrinsic Social (Es) motivation, and a lack of a Questing (Q) approach. These hypotheses were confirmed. When Fundamentalism was controlled, high Intrinsics were more accepting of homosexuals than low Intrinsics. Participants were more opposed to homosexuals than they were to heterosexuals, but no more opposed than they were to liars and racists. While there was some evidence that fundamentalist antipathy toward homosexuals is consistent with their theological ideology (F correlated with morally legitimated antipathy), there was substantial evidence that it was in excess of what is required by their ideology (F correlated with nonmorally legitimated antipathy, and with several indicators of excess antipathy).

918;1999;Contextualizing the back-to-the-land experience with mindfulness, a variant of meditative phenomena, within deep ecology's contention that humankind requires a fundamental shift in consciousness in order to insure ecological sustainability, this study compares and contrasts those variables that explain variance in mindfulness, operationalized as a quasi-religious indicator, with those that explain variance in church attendance, a measure of formal religious behavior. Drawing on a national sample for a mailed questionnaire survey of back-to-the-landers, the study found that the predictor variables for mindfulness share little overlap with those that explain variance for church attendance. The exception is spiritual mindedness, itself a quasi-religious measure, which has a statistically significant relationship with both mindfulness and church attendance. The data suggest, then, that the religious and the quasi-religious are relatively independent spheres of human behavior and sentiment. It would appear, consequently, at least in terms of the back-to-the-land sample and the assumptions of deep ecology, that the adherents of organized religion are not as likely to be disposed towards ecologically sustainable frames of mind as those who center their spirituality on quasi-religious practices such as mindfulness.

919;1999;Enduring membership in communal new religions may have lasting effects when long-term members exit because of partial or complete movement disintegration. Data from two distinctly different groups of women, 20 former members of the 1970s Shiloh Youth Revival Centers and 20 former residents of the 1980s communal city of Rajneeshpuram, suggest that extended membership fundamentally redirects women's priorities. The women from each group changed the courses of their lives because they conserved the gender doctrine articulated within their movements, for more than a decade after their departures. Gender doctrine involves patterned definitions of femininity and masculinity embedded in every religion's overall doctrine. It delimits gender differences, the nature of deity(ies), the division of labor, interpersonal bonds, sexuality, and procreation.  Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion.

921;1999;Recent examinations of the influence of fundamentalist Protestant orientations on educational attainment have brought new life to debates over the material consequences of culture. In this paper we examine how parents' fundamentalist orientations influence their children's educational attainment. We use data from the Youth Parent Socialization Panel Study to demonstrate the influence of parents' fundamentalism on children's attainment. We divide the sample to show how the influence of parents' fundamentalism varies by gender of the child and by the youth's fundamentalism. We find that fundamentalist parents hinder the educational attainment of their nonfundamentalist children, while they actually are more supportive of male Fundamentalist children's educational attainment than are nonfundamentalist parents.

922;1999;"Religion being multifarious and multiplex and not to be explained by one single psychology, cultural psychology is presented as a way to access the specificity of spiritual phenomena being constituted by diverse (subcultures. As an example of a religious ""form of life"" hitherto not approached - even considered impossible to approach - by psychology, the article introduces The bevindelijken, a group of experience-oriented conservative Calvinists in the Netherlands. Contemporary theorizing about ""embodiment"" is pointed out as viable in its exploration. After reflecting on methodological difficulties that had to be dealt with in empirical research, social constructionism, especially in its rhetorical-responsive version, is drawn on to explain some of the paradoxes of the peculiar concept of ""conversion,"" central to bevindelijke spirituality. As in many non-Western countries, but also with several more or less traditional religious groups in the West - where religion is a major shaping force in various, sometimes even almost all, domains of private and public life, and where people more often than not fail to distinguish between the two - bevindelijke believers have embodied (Bourdieu) knowledge of the third kind (Shotter) about their religion. Bevindelijke identity does not just consist in membership in some church, in affirming specific theological doctrines, in joining an inner circle or even in being able to account for one's religious experiences in a certain stylized way, but predominantly in an all-pervading style, belonging to a specific life form (Wittgenstein), displaying itself in and through the body.

923;1999;"Social characteristics of Neopagans from across the United States are described on the basis 643 self-administered questionnaires. A majority of these new religionists are young to middle-aged adults; a slight majority are women; and most of them are white, working-class to middle-class, urbanites. Except for their rejection of traditional religion and selection of this innovative alternative, they are rather ordinary Americans. Neopaganism cannot be explained away by socially marginal participants. Yet, much more research and interpretation will be needed for an adequate scholarly understanding of this increasingly significant and intriguing new American religion.

924;1999;Studies of clergy career stress often operationalize stress in terms that are insufficiently grounded in the actual experiences of ministers, making it difficult to identify specific problematic interactions and assess their impact. The empirical and anecdotal literature on clergy suggest that intrusive demands on ministers and their families are a significant source of distress. Thus, a new instrument, the Ministry Demands Inventory, was created to assess congregational demands using ratings of the frequency and impact of 17 concrete events experienced in pastoral ministry. Data collected from a random national sample of pastors from five Protestant denominations are analyzed to determine the prevalence of each type of demand, and their relationship to measures of career attitude and subjective well-being. Results indicate that four types of congregational intrusiveness can be distinguished, and that in general, intrusive demands are negatively associated with attitude and well-being.

925;1999;The National Congregations Study (NCS) was conducted in conjunction with the 1998 General Social Survey (GSS). The 1998 GSS asked respondents who attend religious services to name their religious congregation, thus generating a nationally representative sample of religious congregations. Data about these congregations were collected via a one-hour interview with one key informant - a minister, priest, rabbi, or other staff person or leader - from 1236 congregations. Information was gathered about multiple aspects of congregations' social composition, structure, activities, and programming. This article describes NCS methodology and presents selected univariate results in four areas: denominational ties, size, political activities, and worship practices.

926;1999;"The purpose of this study was to investigate whether religiosity stems more from emotion regulation strategies to obtain felt security (the compensation hypothesis) in the case of perceived insecurity of parental attachment and more from socialization of religious standards (the revised correspondence hypothesis) in the case of perceived security of parental attachment. Questionnaire data containing retrospective measures of perceived attachment to parents, socialization-based and emotionally based religiosity, sudden religious conversion, and characteristics of religious change were collected from 156 students. Results supported the revised correspondence hypothesis in that security of attachment was positively linked to socialization-based religiosity and to gradual religious changes that were associated with early onset and life themes indicating adoption of religious standards, whereas compensatory themes were uncharacteristic. The compensation hypothesis received support in that attachment insecurity (either avoidance or ambivalence) was positively related to emotionally based religiosity, sudden religious conversions, and intense religious changes that were characterized by late onset and compensatory life themes, whereas themes indicating adoption of religious standards were uncharacteristic. Parallels were drawn to the issue of religiosity as stemming from ""within"" (insecurity) or ""without"" (security) and to the concepts of ""once-born"" (security) and ""twice-born"" (insecurity) religious individuals. Suggestions for necessary methodological improvements in future studies were outlined.  Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, 1999."
927;1999;"The religious attributions of 363 Presbyterian Congregational members were examined to see how they affected coping responses across a range of situations. We compared the multiple sufficient schemata (attributions to God or secular causes) and two proximal-distal models (distant God and secular causes; distant God plus God's direct control in some situations). Results failed to support the first two models but were consistent with direct and indirect divine causation in uncontrollable, severe, and pleasant situations. Simple theological arguments that committed Presbyterians would assert God's direct control because of belief in God's sovereignty were not upheld. There were also small but significant direct and indirect effects of different religious attributions on adaptive coping. These findings point to the complexity of religious attributions and the need for a proximal-plus-distal model of religious attributions.  Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, 1999."
928;1999;"The ritual of religious serpent handling, among independent Holiness-Pentecostal groups of the southeastern United States, has been often construed by social scientific theories and popular media to be pathological and bizarre. Leaving aside such theoretical presuppositions regarding this practice, this study utilized phenomenological interpretation to analyze a collection of 18 extemporaneous sermons given by serpent handlers during the course of worship services. Interpretation of these transcribed sermons revealed that a pattern of five major themes described the meaning of the phenomenon of serpent handling from the perspective of the serpent handlers themselves. As an embodied event, the taking up of serpents within the context of sacred worship involved the experience of: (1) Being ""Moved"" upon by God, (2) a Life/Death Vitality, (3) an ""Us""/""Them"" Specialness, (4) a Power of True Knowing, and (5) ""Joy Unspeakable."" The value of qualitative research in psychological investigations, especially of a first-person perspective, is suggested, and concerns for further research within this religious tradition are noted.

929;1999;"The Seventh-day Adventist Church in the United States has been following a well-defined trajectory from sect toward denomination for the past century: it has reduced tensions with its surrounding environment by removing antagonisms between itself and the state and other religious organizations and as its members have become less peculiar in their lifestyles and beliefs and more integrated into society. However, over the past 30 years it has received an influx of immigrants from countries of the developing world who, generally, are more sectarian in their beliefs and behavior and more confrontative of other religious groups than is the typical American Adventist today. This process is especially advanced in some metropolitan areas such as New York, where Adventism has been transformed from a church of Caucasians and African Americans to a body where nine out of 10 members are now ""new immigrants."" This paper poses the question of whether the influx of immigrants will reverse the trajectory of Adventism in North America, making it generally more sectarian. After considering data gathered primarily in metropolitan New York, it concludes that the flow of immigrants has resulted in a temporary slowing of the movement from sect toward denomination at the local level where the immigrants are concentrated, but that the process of immigrant assimilation ensures that the dominant trajectory will continue.

930;1999;"The status of the Christian Right is usually evaluated by an examination of their successes in the legislative realm, the fate of particular Christian Right groups, and the limiting effects of cultural pluralism on religious exclusivism. These analyses usually conclude that the success of the Christian Right is limited. Despite predictions and arguments to the contrary, the activist Christian Right, whose various groups are now generally summarized as the New Christian Right (NCR), have continued to achieve greater prominence in American political discourse. Factors such as the willingness of some Christian Right groups to accentuate the secular aspects of their agenda, and the embrace of NCR groups by secular political leaders, are evidence of the rising fortunes of the Christian Right. Also, the ""culture war"" rhetoric employed by the Christian Right has been highly effective in the appropriation of valued rhetorical symbols in American public discourse. Finally, the authors explore the conditions of a postmodern cultural and intellectual climate of pluralism and relativism which provides fallow ground for the tolerance of even the most extreme of ""culture war"" rhetoric. The authors conclude that the status of the Christian Right is best assessed through consideration of evolving social forces with which the Christian Right may find affinity, and from which the Christian Right may benefit.

931;1999;This article develops a phenomenology of in-church worship and then compares how people experience worship in-church with worship via television. This research uses a semiotic phenomenological methodology to study in-depth the lived experience of in-church worship. It uses descriptions provided by participants to develop emergent themes and an interpretation of in-church worship. Finally, it uses these themes and interpretation to compare the experiences of worshipping in-church with worshipping by television.  Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, 1999.
932;1999;This note uses systematic data gathered on state legislators in Wisconsin to present an empirical test of Allen Hertzke's suggestion that there is a connection between legislators' faith and the access they give to religious groups. It does so by regressing dependent variables which measure the extent of contact between legislators and religious advocacy organizations on various demographic background and personal religiosity variables. The analysis confirms Hertzke's contention that characteristics of legislators - including religious factors - matter for religious group access. But the relationship between faith and access is not the same for all groups. The connection is strongest for conservative religious groups. The strategy of the Christian Right to elect religious candidates seems wise in light of this finding. Although access to legislators on the basis of their faith was only positive for conservative religious advocacy organizations, liberal and Catholic organizations did have higher levels of access to legislators with higher levels of education, which may be of more consequence since the more highly educated legislators tend to be in more influential positions in the legislature.

933;1999;This paper explores the sorts of future organizational scripts doctrinally conservative Catholics present in thinking about the impact of organizational change. Using data from a self-administered mail survey of randomly selected members of the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights, I focus on how respondents construe the possible changes for the church if women were to be ordained. The study finds interpretive differentiation among this relatively homogeneous group highlighting incongruities between official accounts and the views articulated at the grassroots. Among the study's main findings, a substantial minority of respondents presented scripts that were positively disposed toward women's ordination. Among respondents who were negatively disposed toward change, a substantial minority depicted women in negative ways that deviated from their portrayal in official church teaching.
934;1999;This study of 168 Protestant and Catholic churches in northern California describes how control over church work was distributed among clergy and lay people, and examines the effects of church organizational characteristics on work arrangements. Surprisingly high levels of shared control over church work were found, indicating that lay participation - even in work traditionally associated with the clergy role - is a common feature of modern churches. Church environment, operationalized as polity, affected work arrangements: Churches embedded in more centralized decision-making environments reported more tasks under clergy control and fewer under lay control. The results also suggest that, with respect to work arrangements in churches, similarity to the institutional environment is not driven by regulatory forces but rather by normative or mimetic forces.

935;1999;This study of 411 undergraduates utilized the short form of the Bem Sex Role Inventory (BSRI) and a modified version of the Hood Mysticism Scale (M-scale) to examine the relationship of gender orientation with mystical experience. The hypothesis - that participants classified on the BSRI as feminine or androgynous each would score significantly higher on mysticism than persons classified as masculine - was confirmed. The suggestion is made that persons who score high on mysticism are persons who have developed a feminine self-schema cognitive structure through which they process data in a way that emphasizes the unity of and identification with reality. The finding can be interpreted as lending support to theorists who argue for a constructivist understanding of the mystical experience.  Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, 1999.
936;1999;This study uses data from the 1993 General Social Survey to test hypotheses specific to the relationships among Christian and environmental beliefs and behaviors in the American public. When examined using hierarchical linear regressions that enter demographic variables in the first block, religion variables appear to be weak predictors of environmental attitudes and behaviors. After examining belief in God, biblical literalism, fundamentalist tradition, graceful image of God, church attendance and prayer, only membership in a fundamentalist tradition was associated with (weak) support for the environment. Contrary to hypotheses, more frequent prayer was associated with stronger support for the environment, even after demographic controls. While fundamentalism was positively associated with prayer, fundamentalist tradition and frequency of prayer were associated with environmentalism in different directions. When examined absent other religion variables, the interaction between fundamentalism and frequency of prayer did not significantly account for variance in any of the three dependent measures of environmentalism. Overall, religion variables appear to be weak predictors of environmentalism in America.  Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, 1999.
937;1999;Through analyses of a national survey of Italians (N = 983) conducted in 1990, we study the effect of moral cosmology on political attitudes. We argue that modernists are more theologically individualistic than the religiously orthodox in that they see individuals themselves, not a deity, as being responsible for their fates and as being the ultimate moral arbiters. We hypothesize that modernists, as theological individualists, are culturally individualistic in supporting personal freedom on issues of abortion, sexuality, religious education, and gender roles, and are also economically individualistic in believing that the poor or jobless, not the community or state, should solve their own problems. We find strong support for these hypotheses: Italian modernists are culturally to the left but economically to the right of their orthodox counterparts.  Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion.
938;1999;Traditional religion is often assumed to contribute to partner abuse, although empirical tests of this assumption have been hampered by coarse measurement of religion, socially desirable responding, and neglect of contextual moderators, such as whether an abuse victim's behavior upholds or violates religious values. In an attempt to address these issues, we asked 90 undergraduates to complete measures of religious orientation, then read about a woman who was abused by her boyfriend after she refused his marriage proposal because she wished not to marry outside her faith (value-affirming), was not sure that she loved him (value-neutral), or thought that she might be a lesbian (value-violating) Intrinsic religious orientation predicted liking for the victim and justification of her behavior when she upheld religious values, whereas it predicted liking for the abuser and sympathetic attributions for his behavior when the victim violated religious values. Thus, whether religion discourages or encourages tolerance for abuse may depend on who is being abused.  Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, 1999.
939;1999;"Using data from the 1972-1996 General Social Surveys, no difference greater than sampling variation is found between Protestants and Catholics in the most recent 5-year period (1992-1996) in the proportion holding either a pro-life or a pro-choice position on abortion. Sociological factors underlying this convergence are found to be: a steep decline in church attendance over the period among Catholics, but not Protestants; increasing variance from church teaching even among the highly committed; and strong polarization in opinion by age. A loglinear model fitting contrasting linear trends for Protestants and Catholics in successive 5-year categories of age, cohort and period provides an extremely close fit to the data. However, younger, highly committed Protestants (even liberal Protestants) are growing much more restrictive and while younger, highly committed Catholics are growing much more permissive on abortion. This combination of within-group polarization and between-group convergence provides qualified support for the thesis of religious restructuring advanced by Wuthnow and Hunter, but more detailed analysis reveals complex countercurrents of opinion that defy theoretical systematization. It is argued that the future behavior of the opposing trends - whether they continue, producing a new divergence, or diminish, producing continued equivalence - will adjudicate between theoretical strategies for future research.

940;1999;Using pooled time series with random and fixed effects regression models, we examine the effect of age, period, and family life course events on a measure of religious influence on daily life in a panel of 1,339 adults interviewed three times between 1980 and 1992. The results show a significant, non-linear increase in religiosity with age, with the greatest increase occurring between ages 18 and 30. We also found a significant decline in religiosity between 1980 and 1988, but no evidence of a period effect between 1988 and 1992. Comparison of fixed and random effects solutions found little evidence that a cohort effect accounted for the age findings. The age effect was significantly stronger for Catholics than Protestants and the lower religiosity of males was also significantly stronger for Catholics. Adding children in the range from age two to ten significantly increased religiosity, but family life course events accounted for little if any of the age effect.

941;2000;"A nationally representative survey was conducted of adult Americans who were currently involved in prayer groups, Bible studies, or other religiously oriented small groups. The purpose of the study was to determine if these respondents had engaged in forgiving behavior as a result of being in their group and, if so, to ascertain which group activities were most likely to facilitate this behavior. Of the 1,379 respondents, 61 percent said their group had helped them to forgive someone, 71 percent said they had experienced healings of relationships as a result of their group, and 43 percent said they had worked on improving a broken relationship in recent months. Group activities generating ""social capital"" or ""cultural capital"" were mostly unrelated to these responses, while activities involving ""emotional capital"" and ""spiritual capital"" showed strong positive relationships. Further analysis suggests that forgiving behavior is especially facilitated by groups that emphasize prayer, sharing, and learning about forgiveness. The study also suggests that forgiving behavior may have such consequences as encouraging prosocial involvement, helping to overcome addictions, and promoting emotional well-being."
942;2000;"An analysis of the social organization of Buddhist groups and networks in metropolitan Chicago sheds light on the social organization of Buddhism and other new religions in American cities generally. Following an overview of the history and geography of Buddhist Chicago, this essay examines the dynamics underlying the emergence of local Buddhist groups and networks under two main headings: religious identities and sociological factors. First, Buddhism's various branches, traditions, and lineages are discussed; sociological factors discussed include organizational types, ethnic/racial distinctions, sociological functions played by Buddhism for ""culture Buddhists"" and ""convert Buddhists,"" and the role of local social dynamics in the emergence, proliferation, and interaction of Buddhist groups. As the field of American Buddhist studies enters a period of renewed productivity, this essay offers a conceptual framework for understanding major issues that can benefit both researchers within the field and interested social scientists outside of it."
943;2000;Considering China's history of unfavorable treatment of mainland Chinese Christians, the authors hypothesize that Christians in Hong Kong reflected their concern over the future protection of religions freedom during the 1995 Legislative Council election, the last election before the handover of the British colony to Chinese sovereignty. We have looked at the relative contributions of individual disposition, the China factor and church influence on the presence of Hong Kong Christians at the polling booth on election day. Our analysis found that Hong Kong Christians are subjected more to the influence of the latter two factors. The influence of socio-economic status is relatively unimportant in determining the voting propensity of Hong Kong Christians. While both Catholics and Protestants are influenced by general church teachings, this research found that Catholic voters are more subject to their church s organizational mobilization than Protestant voters.
944;2000;Early in the twentieth century, Italian Protestants in the United States comprised a religious minority in the Italian Catholic community and an ethnic minority in the American one. Because the assimilation of Protestants from heavily Catholic countries is little studied, I examine the life cycle of three Italian Protestant churches in three denominations in Rochester, New York in order to explain why they disappeared earlier than did their Catholic counterparts. When the second generation Italian Protestants attained adolescence, religious identity with American Protestants overrode ethnic identity, accelerating their assimilation. The Italian Protestant churches had become middle-class American organizations save for the use of Italian, a fatal contradiction. By 1960, all three churches had died, but all of the ethnic Catholic and national Orthodox parishes had survived.
945;2000;"Extensive world-wide emigration to Canada has resulted in the widely-held perception that this self-declared, ""multicultural"" country is characterized by considerable religious diversity. National census data, however, suggest that such a religious mosaic is largely a myth. The proportion of Canadians who identify with Christianity remains high, while those who adhere to Other Faiths has risen only slightly over time. To the extent that religious intermarriage takes place - primarily with Catholics and Protestants - the tendency is for Other Faith women and men to raise their children in their partner's tradition. As a result of such assimilation patterns, Christianity continues to enjoy a significant numerical monopoly in Canada. The census further reveals that smaller new religions are also having difficulty making inroads. In short, Canada is characterized by an extremely tight ""religious market"" that continues to be dominated by Catholic and Protestant ""companies""."
946;2000;In recent decades, feminists have been questioning patriarchal religions. As a result, many find themselves ambivalent about their religious and spiritual identities. This paper presents a model of identity formation that addresses the processes by which potentially conflicted identities are integrated. This model is based on research about how women who identify themselves as both Jewish and feminist create unconflicted Jewish feminist identities. Through a process of sifting through their available options, they have chosen to identify with only those aspects of Judaism and feminism that satisfy their feminist, religious, and perhaps most importantly, their spiritual, needs. Because these needs vary, what it means to be a Jewish feminist is not static. Three types of Jewish feminist identity - inclusionist, transformationist, and reinterpretationist - are identified.
947;2000;"In the early years of the two associations, relatively few papers or sessions focused on religions other than Christianity or on religion outside North America, with the partial exception of Judaism. The combined effects of organizational growth and events in the surrounding world, however, led to progressively more treatment of ""other"" religions and the religions of ""others."" Beginning in the mid-1960s, specific themes of ""otherness"" established themselves in the meeting programs, including African-American religion, women and religion, new religions, and Latin American/Latino/a religion. In the 1980s attention spread to the religions of Africa, Eastern Europe, East Asia, the Caribbean, among other places. Although the process is far from complete, its acceleration during the 1990s allows one to predict that it will continue."
948;2000;"In this paper, we explore how Protestant denominations use education to stratify their pastors among lower and higher income jobs and how this use of education intersects with gender. We assume that reliance on education as an indication of job qualification ultimately reflects accommodation to secular norms and hypothesize that it will be practiced most strongly in theologically liberal contexts. Next, we hypothesize that women will benefit from education more than men, a pattern that is typical of secular labor markets. And we predict that education will have a stronger effect on income in denominations where regional clergy administrators have influence in matching pastors to jobs. Data are taken from the 1994 ""Ordained Women and Men Study"" and consist of career information on clergy in fifteen denominations. Contrary to expectations, clergy degrees have a stronger effect on income in conservative than in liberal denominations. We further find that women clergy receive lower income returns to their degrees in denominations requiring a Master of Divinity for ordination but receive higher returns in the others. Finally, results show that seminary prestige is more beneficial in denominations where pastors are hired directly by congregations rather than placed in congregations by regional clergy administrators."
949;2000;In this paper, we utilize GIS (Geographic Information System) mapping data to locate eleven immigrant congregations and the residential addresses of their members in Houston, Texas. Combining this information with ethnographic data allows us to understand how ecological variables impact organizational characteristics of religious institutions. Specifically, we combine GIS and ethnographic data on immigrant congregations in Houston, Texas, to analyze characteristics that make them more parish or niche-like in structure. We demonstrate that the combination of GIS techniques and standard field methods yields the greatest potential to provide a comprehensive understanding of what congregations mean to their members.
950;2000;In this study we explore individual's experiences of identity integration between their sexual orientation and religious beliefs. Using both qualitative and quantitative research methods, we examined identity integration in forty members and participants of the Metropolitan Community Church of New York (MCC/NY), a gay-positive church located in Mid-town Manhattan. The survey and interview data collected showed that: (1) a majority of the research participants reported that they had successfully integrated their homosexual and religious identities, (2) being integrated was related to higher role involvement at MCC/NY, being a member of the church, attending more MCC/NY worship services and activities/ministries, and attending MCC/NY for more years, (3) lesbians were less likely than gay men to report past conflict between their identities, and more likely to report being fully integrated, and (4) MCC/ NY played an important role in helping these participants achieve integration between their homosexual and religious identities.
951;2000;"In Western Europe, ""religious sociology"" developed after the Second World War and, in order to improve its theory and methods, the Socit International de Sociologie Religieuse (SISR) was established in 1948. After comparing its aims with those of the American associations, the author discusses the reception of religious sociology by the churches in Europe. The churches were interested in the description and analyses of the social context in which they were embedded, but they rejected the analyses of religion per se. This ambiguous relationship can also be traced in the development of the SISR, where over the years a ""sociology of religion"" developed. To explain this change, the author stresses, among other factors, the important impact of the interactions between European and American sociologists of religion during the conferences organized by professional associations. The profession and not the churches became the reference of a new generation of sociologists. Religion rather than the churches became the focus of study, which restored our discipline to mainstream sociology. In a concluding section, new tasks for the professional organizations are suggested and the need for intercontinental research projects is stressed."
952;2000;Investigations into religious attributions have focused on attributer's immediate, proximal causes of events, paying little attention to underlying, distal explanations. In an effort to explain the relatively low incidence of religious attributions and further a new model of proximal-distal attributions, we present two experiments investigating the proximal and distal use of religious and nonreligious supernatural attributions. Participants in both studies were presented a series of sixteen vignettes that varied on several attribution-relevant dimensions. After reading each vignette, subjects gave an initial explanation for the event, and were then probed for any underlying explanations. Experiment 1 used an interview format that allowed participants maximum latitude when explaining the event's outcome. Consistent with our predictions, participants perceived God as having a greater distal than proximal influence, though this difference was not evident for attributions to Satan or nonreligious supernatural agents. Experiment 2 was performed via a microcomputer, with a participant's initial attributional response branching to a set of appropriate distal explanations. Overall, the results suggest that attributer's perceive God working through indirect influences rather than direct intervention, with this effect being moderated by the attributer's level of religiosity. This pattern was evident in the use of God as a distal explanation as well as in the distal explanations to proximal attributions to God.
953;2000;It is doubtful whether there ever has been a rise-fall-rebirth of the psychology of religion. While the claim has marginal merit for American academic psychology, it has little application in other cultures or even within American psychology of religion outside mainstream psychology. The psychology of religion has always been and remains tied to key individuals who sustain the field. This historical fact is important in understanding the role of the JSSR in the field. Early psychologists of religion such as Hall and James set the pattern for two distinctively different approaches to the psychology of religion. Hall's approach was methodologically restrictive, inherently reductive, and came to dominate the academic psychology of religion. James' approach was methodological plural, receptive to the evidential force of religious experience, and quickly marginalized within American psychology. These opposing orientation continue to influence the psychology of religion in societies such as the SSR and its journal. A review of the psychologist editors of JSSR illustrates that the psychology of religion remains a marginal interest of mainstream psychology. It survives because of the interdisciplinary nature of the SSSR and its journal.
954;2000;Numerous works have detailed the breakdown of brand loyalty within society over the last forty years and its results. Whether examining political loyalties, religious loyalties, or loyalties to brands such as Lucky Strike cigarettes, each study has noted a lowering of traditional barriers to switching brands and the creation of a nation of individualist choosers (Friedman 1990). Here I attempt to suggest some connections between religious and political loyalties. Using the 1993 General Social Survey, I operationalize religious loyalty in four ways and suggest three mechanisms through which religious loyalty is connected to political loyalty: psychological ties, social ties, and social circumstances. I find significant effects of different conceptions of religious loyalty encouraging party loyalties, steadfast voting, and loyalty to one party's presidential candidates across two elections.
955;2000;Proponents of the supply side approach to religion theorize that religious market share - the proportion of people in a geographical area who belong to a given denomination - is inversely related to religious commitment in that denomination. They argue that a small market share motivates religious leaders to compete harder in the religious market place, increasing the participation of members. Another perspective, often associated with secularization theory, make the opposite prediction. It argues that people find it difficult to remain religiously committed in social environments where they are numerical minorities because other people do not reinforce their beliefs and practices. We use data from a large study of financial giving to analyze the relationship between market share and commitment for five denominations in the United States. We find that market share has a negative effect on church financial giving within all five denominations and a weaker negative effect on attendance in three of the denominations. We explore whether these effects are the spurious byproducts of pro-religious cultural norms associated with either the South or the presence of conservative Protestants in local areas. In models pooling all denominations, the negative effect of market share on financial giving and attendance cannot be explained away by either of these factors. However, the effect on attendance can be accounted for by congregational size.
956;2000;Research on volunteering behavior has consistently found a positive relationship between religion and volunteering. Using a sample of churchgoing Protestants (N=1, 738) from the Religious Identity and Influence Survey we examine the specific influences of religiosity, religious identity, religious socialization, and religious social networks on local volunteer activity in church programs and non-church organizations, as well as general volunteering tendencies. These influences are presented within the theoretical framework of religious capital. Logistic regression techniques were applied to determine the strength of the contribution of these influences while accounting for basic background factors. Findings suggest that churchgoing Protestants are influenced by all measures to some degree, but religiosity (specifically participation in church activities) remains the strongest influence. Significant religious influences overall are most pronounced within the context of church-related volunteering which suggests that churchgoing Protestants exhibit a strong sense of community identity through their local churches. A discussion of these results and their implications for volunteering follows.
957;2000;Some scholars have suggested that individual religiosity inhibits deviant behavior. Others have suggested that behavior is more responsive to the influence of religiously-oriented moral communities than to the religiosity of individuals. Still others have suggested that non-religious moral communities, such as sports teams or self-help recovery groups, are just as effective as religious moral communities. The current article examines the associations between addicts 'reductions in drug and alcohol use and religiosity, increase in church attendance, and increase in addiction self-help recovery group attendance, following participation in publicly funded treatment programs. Results indicate that increase in self-help recovery group attendance and church attendance were independently associated with reduction in alcohol use. Only increase in church attendance was significantly associated with reduction in cocaine use. Self-assessed religious conviction was not associated with changes in drug use.
958;2000;The main theme of this article is that the scientific study of religion passed through three stages in its development in the twentieth century. It was well integrated into the mainstream of early social science but by 1950 it had drifted into a more marginal position. The 1980s marked the beginning of a return to a more central position - not only because social scientists specializing in the study of religion were increasingly willing to adopt mainstream premises and paradigms but also because religion was becoming more interesting to other social scientists. Selected illustrations of this pattern of evolution focus on the sociology of knowledge. Marxism, new religious movements, post-modernity, feminism, globalization, and rational choice theory. The conclusion is that the social scientific study of religion is now taking up themes of much broader interest to many social scientists. It has become less defensive, more expansive, more contentious, and perhaps more interesting than it ever was.
959;2000;The most enduring theoretical model for explaining the rise and fall of religious movements has been some form of the church-sect theory. Yet this model offers little explanation for the continued vitality of the Roman Catholic Church. We argue that a key to this institutional success is the Church's ability to retain sect-like revival movements within its boundaries. He demonstrate that religious orders, like Protestant sects, stimulate organizational growth, develop innovations for adapting the church to a new culture or era, and provide institutional support for a high tension faith. Unlike Protestant sects, however, they do so within the institutional church. This source of internal reform and revival helps to explain the long term vitality of the Roman Catholic Church and its ability to operate effectively as a religious monopoly.
960;2000;The paper uses the fortunes of religion in the Nordic and Baltic States to identify weaknesses in the supply-side model of religious behaviour promoted by Stark, Finke and Iannaccone. Changes in religious observance in the Nordic countries over the twentieth century, and comparisons between them, contradict a number of supply-side propositions. Comparisons between the Baltic states similarly show no support for supply-side claims. Instead both clusters suggest that the fate of religion owes more to its links with ethnicity, national consciousness and national conflict and to the theology and ecclesiology of the religion in question than to issues of state regulation.
961;2000;"The Reiss Profile of Fundamental Goals and Motivational Sensitivities, a standardized psychological measure that assesses 15 fundamental desires, was administered to college students (n= 214) and to mental retardation service providers (n = 344), total N = 558, who rated themselves as ""very,"" ""somewhat,"" and ""not"" religious. How religious a person rated himself, called religiosity, was associated with high desire scores for honor and family, and with low desire scores for vengeance and independence. The investigation provided evidence that the desire for dependence on God is unrelated to any desire for psychological weakness (submission to another person or political leader.)."
962;2000;"The research that is presented here explores the role that empathic attachment plays in the development of the religious self. Based on an ethnographic study of modern descendants of the Spanish crypto-Jews, the work applies self-in-relation theory to the study of spirituality and religious belief acquisition among a population of individuals who, in adulthood, have modified their religious world view as a result of their crypto-Jewish heritage. The findings of the research expand the parameters of self-in-relation theory in three important ways: 1) through an examination of the role that empathic attachment plays in adult conversion patterns; 2) through the elaboration of a developmental model that considers the significance of empathic attachment for sons as well as daughters; and 3) through an investigation into the relationship between ethnicity and spiritual development."
963;2000;"The study of new religious movements has been developing in recent decades in an intellectual context in which both religion and its scholarly investigation appear to be more significant and more controversial than seemed to be the case in the earliest decades of SSSR. The present paper recounts the main themes of early work on nrms in the 1970s and 80s and subsequently explores three current areas of conceptual ambiguity and/or intellectual ferment and conflict. Key contemporary issues represent 1) The Boundary Problem or what is a ""new religious movement ""?: 2) The growing salience of the analysis of catastrophic episodes of mass violence_involving nrms; and 3) Recent claims to the effect that scholars in the sociology of religion and religious studies who do research on nrms have been led by their strong ideological commitment to the defense of religious liberty to take up a defensive attitude toward controversial ""cults"" to a degree which has undermined objectivity."
964;2000;This essay addresses the issue of applied research in, on, and for religious organizations, especially trends in how research has been carried out in relation to religious organizations. It asks how applied research has changed, and what are the implications for the larger field of social scientific research. The essay begins with some general comments about the challenges that face religious organizations in a post-traditional world that require reflexive monitoring of their traditions and ecclesial practices if these organizations are to survive and engage the future in a significant way. Applied research is defined as one form of reflexive monitoring and includes both (1) research commissioned by leaders of religious organization as an aid for understanding a particular situation or shaping policy or programs, and (2) research that, though not commissioned by religious organizations, has as its primary intent providing religious organizations with policy-relevant information. Using this definition, the essay then traces trends in applied research from the earlier part of the twentieth century to the present, focusing especially on the past fifty years. It concludes with an assessment of these research efforts as examples of reflexive monitoring.
965;2000;This paper analyzes religious socialization as it relates to schooling success. I propose and test a multilevel model of involvement in church activities as providing integration and motivation toward schooling success among metropolitan U.S. public high school sophomores. Results indicate that respondents' participation in church activities is related to heightened educational expectations, and that these more intensely religious students score higher on standardized math/reading tests, even while controlling for variables that often show religious effects to be spurious. The hypothesis that church involvement's effect varies by ecological context - it being a better predictor for students in poorer neighborhoods than average or wealthy neighborhoods - was not supported.
966;2000;"This paper contends that the social scientific study of religion has long labored under a chafing constraint and a misleading premise. It suggests that our primary focus should be on the sacred, and that religion is just one among many possible sources of the sacred. Defining religion ""substantively"" but the sacred ""functionally"" helps to resolve a long-standing tension in the field. Broadened conceptions of the sacred and of ""sacralisation"" help to defuse the conflict among the two very different versions of secularization theory: the ""all-or-nothing"" versus the ""middle range."" Meanwhile, a conceptual typology of the sacred pivots around the intersections of two distinctions (compensatory vs. confirmatory and marginal vs. institutional). This generates four distinct scenarios: the sacred as integrative, the sacred as quest, the sacred as collectivity, and the sacred as counter-culture. The paper concludes with three admonitions for research in the area."
967;2000;"This paper examines an expanding focus in the content of what members of SSSR study and show how this change is reflected in the publications in the journal. I offer four factors that might effect what we study: changes in the world, changes in who we are, changes in funding sources, and changes in the theoretical frames. I discuss the ""cultural turn"" as new theoretical frame, which has had important implications for the study of religion. I then return to the question of changes in the world. I end with my expectation that we will see greater yet inclusiveness in the future."
968;2000;"This paper examines Reformed clergy across two different settings - the United States and Scotland in an effort to determine how theological orthodoxy is related to political participation. The paper demonstrates that (1) clergy in both settings tend to be politically active (2) the level of clergy political activity tends to be greater in the United States than in Scotland (3) the relationship between orthodoxy and political activity is complex, varying by the specific type of activity examined and (4) while theologically orthodox and modernist clergy tend to differ in the nature of their political activities, there is no longer a major ""gap"" in level of political activity between the two groups of ministers."
969;2000;This paper explores women's leadership roles in the sociology of religion. I focus on the women presidents of three social science research organizations that specialize in the study of religious phenomena: the Society for the Scientific Study of Religion, the Association for the Sociology of Religion, and the Religious Research Association, and make some comparisons with women presidents of the American Sociological Association. This paper draws on the work of Marie Augusta Neal for a sociological perspective on women and religion. It suggests policy implications for women and other marginalized groups, and concludes with personal reflections on the transformation process.
970;2000;This paper uses the 1998 National Congregations Study (NCS) to investigate the demographic and organizational characteristics of female-headed congregations in the United States. Our findings significantly extend knowledge about the demographic characteristics of these congregations. Counterintuitively, female-led congregations are more likely to be found in urban areas than in other locations, and they are more prevalent among African American congregations - particularly those with no denominational ties - and among ethnically mixed congregations. Our findings also confirm previous research on women clergy which indicates that, compared with congregations led by men, there is a paucity of organizational resources in female-headed congregations.
971;2000;Using data from separate studies conducted in 1988-89 and 1998, we explore changes in the issue agendas of women clergy. Rosenstone and Hansen (1993) argue persuasively that mobilization often occurs due to a commitment to a particular political issue. Our data allow us to test three separate hypotheses about the evolution of women clergy's issue agendas over the course of a decade that saw an unprecedented number of women enter the ministry. Shifts in the issue agendas of women clergy suggest a model of issue agenda evolution including four possible explanations for change: public agenda shifts, changes resulting from the growing number of women clergy, or ideological stability.
972;2000;While most religions provide a meaning system that helps people cope with personal problems, there has been relatively little research on how and why men and women seek religious consolation and comfort. Data from a national longitudinal survey, Americans' Changing Lives, Waves I and II, were used to examine whether physical and mental health problems precipitate seeking religious consolation. The findings indicate that seeking religious consolation is most likely among those who identify with and practice a religion suggesting that religious consolation intensifies among religious persons. Chronic (non-serious) conditions were associated with increased religious seeking over time, and cancer was associated with higher religious seeking, especially among women. Depression was associated with greater seeking of religious consolation among both men and women. The results reveal clearly that women are more likely than men to seek religious consolation, but men seek religious consolation for a wider range of health and situational problems (e.g., unemployment). The findings also demonstrate the importance of considering the role of religious consolation in studies of religion and health.
973;2001;A detailed questionnaire was mailed to every Methodist minister engaged in circuit ministry in Great Britain. Each of the 1,339 respondents completed the Revised Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQR-S). The male ministers recorded lower psychoticism scores than the male population norms. The female ministers recorded lower neuroticism scores than the female population norms. These findings support the view that ministry may appeal particularly to men who value and display the tender-minded personality characteristics associated with femininity and to women who value and display the stable personality characteristics associated with masculinity. Implications of these findings for ministry are discussed.
974;2001;"A small but growing literature focuses on the links between religion and family violence. Several recent studies report that regular religions attendance is inversely related to abuse among both men and women. After outlining a series of theoretical arguments regarding possible direct and indirect links between religious involvement and domestic violence, we analyze these relationships using data from Wave I of the National Survey of Families and Households (NSFH-I). Among the key findings: (1) regular religions attendance is inversely associated with the perpetration of domestic violence; (2) among men, this protective effect is evident only among weekly attenders, whereas among women, the protective effect also surfaces among monthly attenders; (3) although the estimated net effects of religions attendance are generally somewhat larger in models of self-reports of domestic violence, this link also remains strong and statistically significant in models of partner reports of violence; and (4) moreover, the inverse association between religious attendance and abuse persists even with statistical controls for measures of (a) social integration and social support, (b) alcohol and substance abuse, and (c) low self-esteem and depression. We conclude by discussing a number of implications of these findings, and by identifying several promising directions for future research."
975;2001;Although most scholars find that religious involvement is negatively related to depression, questions still remain regarding how individuals benefit from such involvement and evidence from nationally representative samples is rare. In this paper, I expand upon previous research by considering three types of general religious involvement (attendance at religious services, religious salience, and spiritual help-seeking) and three types of effects (linear, curvilinear, and stress-buffering). Using Americans' Changing Lives (House 1989) - a large, nationally representative, and longitudinal data set - I find a U-shaped effect of religious salience on depression, no significant independent effect of service attendance, and a positive effect of spiritual help-seeking. I also find that spiritual help-seeking and religious salience exhibit significant stress-buffering effects, but that these occur only when individuals experience multiple negative life events, and not when they experience any single type of discrete event. The theoretical implications of these effects are discussed, both as they contribute to research on the life stress paradigm and research on the psychology of religion.
976;2001;Although the social scientific study of religion has seen the accumulation of numerous case studies, comparative work involving substantial numbers of cases is rare. In the absence of an accepted agenda for field research, field studies contain information relevant to the study at hand, but do not add systematically to a cumulative database. By contrast, field studies in anthropology may contain idiosyncratic information relevant to the author's interests, but an existing research agenda defines information researchers are expected to include, which has produced an expanding cross-cultural database. In this paper, we propose elements of a research agenda for the study of religious movements, including information related to movements' organizational history and context, mobilization, organization, governance, and outcomes. While this preliminary agenda is subject to refinement by others, it provides a starting point for the accumulation of comparable cases, and a basis for the comparative study of religious movements.
977;2001;"Are those with a high-quest orientation to religion less likely to help a person if that person's behavior violates their values of open-mindedness and tolerance? If so, is it because they have antipathy toward the person or toward the behavior? To answer these questions, sixty undergraduate women were given the opportunity to help either of two same-sex peers win a monetary prize. About one peer, they knew nothing; from the other, they had received two self-disclosing notes. The first note either did or did not reveal that the discloser was intolerant of gays; the second revealed that the discloser wanted the money for an activity that either would or would not promote intolerance of gays. Participants scoring high on measures of quest religion helped the intolerant discloser less than the discloser who was not intolerant when their help would promote intolerance; they did not help the intolerant discloser less when their help would not promote intolerance. These results suggest that a high-quest orientation is associated with antipathy toward the value-violating behavior (intolerance), not toward the value-violating person. The scope of the associated compassion seems relatively broad."
978;2001;Focusing on the Shakers and using census data, this paper quantitatively examines influences on religious commitment and the way these influences differed between new and veteran members. Whereas personal characteristics (age, sex, nativity, and occupation) were the primary sources of influence on the commitment of veteran members, new recruits were also influenced by interpersonal and organizational factors (kinship ties, social bonds, and membership in leading groups). The differential effect of influences on commitment illustrates the nature of the commitment process in a religious commune.
979;2001;Following the 1990 Smith v. Employment Division of Oregon ruling on the limits of religious freedom, many protested that the Supreme Court had opened the door for majoritarian oppression of minority rights. Using data collected on 2,109 court cases on religion from 1981-1996 we document recent trends in court decisions on religion and address questions posed by supply-side theory, legal scholars, and the sociology of law. We find that religious sects and cults were more likely to be involved in court cases and more likely to receive unfavorable rulings. Multivariate models confirm these finding and support the charges of legal scholars that the Smith decision has decreased the rate of rulings favoring religious groups. Finally, we find that the Smith decision had both a period effect and a case precedent effect.
980;2001;"For many years, sociologists have examined the role of religious collectivities in shaping individual attitudes and behaviors. This research has assumed that religious groups are the ""locus of subcultural differences"" in social altitudes. However, scholars have not addressed how denominational mobility or switching affects denominational subcultures. Our research uses data from the General Social Surveys to examine the consequences of switching on denominational subcultures. Our analysis investigates denominational differences in central tendencies and differences in homogeneity for ""switchers"" and those who remain affiliated with the same religious group over the life course. Further, comparisons of both types of religious group differences are adjusted to account for sociodemographic characteristics. Several promising directions for future research on religious variations in social values and attitudes are discussed."
981;2001;In a study designed to investigate the respective roles of religious fundamentalism and right-wing authoritarianism as predictors of prejudice against racial minorities and homosexuals, participants (47 males, 91 females) responded to a series of questionnaire measures of these constructs. Data were analyzed using multiple regression. Consistent with previous research, authoritarianism was a significant and strong positive predictor of both forms of prejudice. With authoritarianism statistically controlled, however, fundamentalism emerged as a significant negative predictor of racial prejudice but a positive predictor of homosexual prejudice. In a second study, we conducted parallel multiple regressions using the correlations from two previously published studies. The Study 1 results were replicated exactly, except that fundamentalism was a nonsignificant predictor of homosexual prejudice. We interpret the results as evidence that Christian fundamentalism consists of a second major component other than authoritarianism - related to Christian belief content - that is inversely related to some forms of prejudice (including racial prejudice) but not others (e.g., homosexual prejudice).
982;2001;It was hypothesized that the study of religion should distinguish between attitudes and religious values/moral obligations such that both aid in predicting religiously relevant behavior and changing either will change behavior. However, if they are distinct, then changing one will not necessarily change the other. For the 195 religious participants, attitudes predicted a church-sponsored blood donation and moral obligations increased that prediction. Using both posttest only and pre-post control group designs, an intervention to shift the effect underlying the attitude increased participants' attitude and donating behavior while a religious values intervention increased moral obligations and behavior. Zero to 4 percent of the control groups donated blood, while 13 to 48 percent of the intervention groups donated blood. Results confirm that psychology of religion should distinguish moral obligations from attitude because (1) additional prediction, (2) changing one does not necessarily change the other, and (3) changes based on religious values impact moral obligations.
983;2001;"Jehovah's Witnesses' long-term development presents an interesting case of evolution in line with the ""deformation thesis,"" an attempt at explaining dramatic shifts in organizational forms, activities, and even beliefs in controversial religious minorities. Derived from resource mobilization tradition, this thesis assumes that radical transformations result from major defensive resource allocation mandated by negative reactions of societal institutions. This is especially the case with reference to the adoption by Jehovah's Witnesses, a millenarian group, of a ""disciplined litigation"" strategy in the 1940s, a pattern later to be incorporated in religious activities and beliefs of the organization. Today, disciplined litigation and its successor, ""vigilant litigation,"" seem legitimate ways to adapt to the prevailing religious climate and structure. As such, it can be conceived as a model for defensive moves taken by ""younger"" controversial religious minorities and reflects the enormous influence of the law and legal systems in shaping minority religions."
984;2001;"Muslims agree that the establishment of an Islamic state requires the implementation of Islamic principles and laws. In Iran, Khomeini and his supporters developed doctrinal justifications for uncontested clerical rule to ensure political order and social conformity. By emphasizing ""communal interest"" in legislation and establishing an extensive institutional mechanism of legal control, the clerics gradually marginalized the Shari'ah and sacrificed the Islamic notion of universality of law for legal territoriality. This legal trend is separating the clerics from their traditional role and is undermining their legitimacy. Ironically, the current attempts at legal and political reform by the reformers, as harshly opposed by the hard-line clerics, would benefit the clerical class by pursuing a more liberal legal and political agenda consistent with the Shari'ah."
985;2001;Previous research on religions institutions and political participation finds that churches can increase participation among their members through the development of civic skills and the distinct political histories of religions traditions. This paper examines the various ways religious institutions promote the political participation of their members. We utilise the 1990 Citizen Participation Study to test seven hypotheses about the connections between religious institutions and political participation. We find, contrary to previous work, that church-gained civic skills and religious tradition do not directly affect political participation among those currently active in religious institutions. Rather, churches bring their parishioners more effectively into the political process through the recruitment of members to politics and when members come to see their church activity as having political consequences.
986;2001;Prior research has shown that church attendance affects voting participation, but has a negative or no effect on more demanding forms of political participation. I argue that this differential for nonelectoral activity partially results from biases in how scholars conceptualize and analyze church attendance variables. To properly measure the influence of church attendance on nonelectoral participation, scholarship needs to account for self-selection biases that hinder accurate analyses. Consistent with the literature, a selection model finds that once fundamentalism's motivating effect is considered, church attendance plays no role in a respondent's participation in local government meetings. The present work provides a partial explanation for why attendance has no effect on more demanding political activity. These findings demonstrate that scholarship should focus attention on prior factors that influence congregants' attendance decisions.
987;2001;Research shows that religion continues to be an important identity marker for new immigrants in the United States. However, immigrant groups differ in the ways they integrate religious and ethnic identities and the emphasis they place on each. In this paper, we argue that majority or minority status of their religious affiliation in the home and host countries is an important, but overlooked, factor in understanding strategies concerning religious and ethnic identities. By comparing two Chinese congregations, a Chinese Buddhist temple and a Chinese Christian church in Houston, Texas, we analyze what happens when an immigrant group moves from majority status in the home country to minority status in the United States (Chinese Buddhists) and when a minority group (Chinese Christians in China) become part of the Christian majority in the United States. We conclude by arguing the importance of going beyond U.S. borders and taking into account factors in their home countries in attempts to understand patterns of adaptation of the new immigrants.
988;2001;"Since the Second Vatican Council (1965), Catholic marital annulments have risen dramatically, especially in the United States. A comparison of American and international rates demonstrates that, consistent with supply-side theories of religion, annulment rates have risen only in countries where the Church competes with other religions institutions. However, supply-side theory cannot explain why the American rate is double that of other countries with competitive religious economies. Historical analysis suggests that the growing number, estrangement, organization, and mobilization of divorced American Catholics motivated the American Church to engage in more intense marketing of annulments. I therefore argue that another variable that incorporates these ""qualities of the target market"" should be considered in future analyses of religious marketing."
989;2001;The collapse of Soviet Communism has brought about sweeping revivals of religion in most of Eastern Europe and the Soviet successor states. This astonishing change in religious activity appears ideal for further testing of the supply-side theory of religious change. In this paper I investigate whether the dramatic religious revival in Hungary can be explained using a supply-side framework. I begin with a brief sketch of the history of religion in 20th-century Hungary in order to place current data in the proper context. Next, I present data from national surveys of Hungary and eyewitness accounts to assess the causal relationship between religious restrictions and religious activity as predicted by supply-side theory. Then I investigate secularization accounts of religious activity in Hungary and conclude that the supply-side thesis best fits the available data. Finally, I indicate the leveling off of the Hungarian revival due to decreased religious competition and posit future expectations concerning religious activity in Hungary.
990;2001;"The present study was designed to investigate the differential influences of exposure to life tragedies and religious contradictions on the tendency to engage in religious questioning (quest orientation). A replication and extension of a study by Burris, Jackson, Tarpley, and Smith (1996) was conducted to determine whether exposure to religious contradictions alone or life tragedies alone would influence quest orientation. Additional experimental conditions attempted to address Batson's (1982) theoretical position that quest orientation results ""from a process of cognitive restructuring in response to existential questions"" (p. 162). The results replicated Burris et al. (1996) and also showed that exposure to tragedy alone led to increases in quest orientation. The results did not support the idea that exposure to contradictions increased quest orientation. Unexpectedly, some evidence was found that exposure to tragedy influenced extrinsic orientation."
991;2001;The purpose of the present cross-sectional questionnaire study was to construct a comprehensive and reliable scale to assess new age orientation as a continuous individual difference variable. Given large increases in new age orientation in Sweden in recent years, an additional purpose was to test our emotional compensation hypothesis by studying connections of retrospective parental and adult romantic attachment in relation to new age orientation, emotionally-based religiosity, and socialization-based religiosity, as well as to study links between attachment and several aspects of spiritual change. The study group included 193 participants from upper secondary school classes, Christian youth organizations, and new age establishments in Stockholm, Sweden. The new age orientation scale was shown to be unidimensional according to an exploratory factor analysis, and to possess adequate reliability and construct validity. In line with the emotional compensation predictions, new age orientation was directly linked to attachment insecurity and emotionally-based religiosity and inversely related to socialization-based religiosity Attachment insecurity was also linked to the experience of spiritual changes, whereas most findings pertaining to characteristics of spiritual change did not support predictions. In general, unlike perceived attachment to parents, adult romantic attachment did not display the predicted pattern of results. It was concluded that attachment theory may make an important contribution by highlighting predisposing factors for new age orientation, as representing one aspect of the emotional compensation profile, but that several methodological improvements are necessary in future studies.
992;2001;The purpose of this correlational study was to examine the relationship of frequency of prayer to eight subcategories of physical and mental health. As part of the ongoing Presbyterian Panel, 1,412 active Presbyterian pastors drawn from a national, random sample were surveyed by mail regarding their frequency of prayer and self-perceptions of health outcomes. The results indicated a high level of functioning overall for all eight categories of physical and mental health. Predictably, frequency of prayer was extremely skewed towards high frequency. Despite a lack of variation in both health and prayer, high frequency of prayer was significantly related to higher scores in three health outcomes: vitality, general health, and mental health. These relationships remained significant in the analysis even after controlling for the influence of demographic variables, such as gender and age. Various explanations of the results are explored.
993;2001;The Supreme Court under Chief Justice Earl Warren did much to expand the free exercise of religion and diminish government endorsement of it. The pace at which this occurred slowed under Chief Justice Burger and is directly challenged by the Court under Chief Justice William Rehnquist. This change is documented, followed by an analysis of what seems to animate Rehnquist.
994;2001;This article examines the impact of parental divorce on the likelihood that an individual has changed their religious identify. Using data from the National Survey of Family and Households, we use a theoretical framework of family structure and community ties to test the hypothesis that religious mobility is more likely among children of divorce compared to those from intact families. Distinguishing between parental divorce in childhood and parental divorce in adulthood allows us to assess the impact of parental divorce on religious socialization. For individuals raised as either moderate Protestant, conservative Protestant or Catholic, parental divorce increases the likelihood of both switching to another religion and apostasy. The impact of divorce is particularly strong for Catholics and conservative Protestants, who are, in general, less likely to be religious mobile. These findings add religious disaffiliation to the set of likely sequelae of parental divorce. In addition, the results of the study highlight the need to consider the relationship between family structure and religious processes in a community context.
995;2001;"This close analysis of the printed media discourse in post-Communist Russia shows various ways of using religious cultural capital in reifying the Russian national identity. This blossoming public religion, contrasted with the generally low level of religiosity as reported by the surveys, became a new phenomenon comparable to similar patterns on an international scale. In the Russian case, the major themes of this public discourse are ""spiritual entropy"" ""symphony"" of state-church relations, religious diversity (pluralism), and the search for a religiously legitimized ""national idea.""."
996;2001;This paper applies the concept of identity to the white racialist or separatist movement, typically referred to as the white supremacist movement in many mainstream publications. While similar racial identity and shared perceptions of the meaning of racialism bind the movement together, there are other important concerns that potentially divide the movement but also have served to attract members to it. One of these potentially divisive areas, the differences in religious views, is explored here through an analysis of the white separatist literature and interviews with movement members. Three belief systems of movement members - Christian or Israel Identity, Church of the Creator, and Odinism - are examined. All three contribute to strengthening the racial identity of while racialists, but are at the same time potentially antagonistic to each other. It is suggested that this religious divide will be a key issue in influencing the future development of the movement.
997;2001;This paper examines an Episcopal campus chapel's search process for a new priest. I argue that gender, at the group level, is a fluid cultural resource that search committee members use in contradictory ways to select a male priest. I illustrate my argument using data drawn from twenty-eight in-depth interviews and participant observation (1994-1995) of a search committee in an Episcopal campus ministry located on the grounds of a southeastern state university. My findings show that a patriarchal agenda can be upheld by a search committee without it ever being specified or codified. Well-intentioned search committee members routinely do gender even as they claim and believe they act in gender-free ways. The contribution this analysis makes to our understanding of congregational search processes and discrimination against female clergy is considered.
998;2001;This paper explores the uneasy relationship between social movements and major political parties by considering the case of the Christian Right and the Republican Party in the 1994 elections. We look at four states where the movement was active in party politics and where Republican electoral fortunes varied from failure to success. We found that the degree of intraparty division generated by the Christian Right seemed to hurt Republicans at the polls, but the level of movement activity in itself apparently helped the Republicans. Most factors associated with support for the Christian Right did not help account for electoral outcomes across the states. Instead, the accessibility of the political party nomination processes to the movement best accounted for the election results: greater party openness was associated with poor results and more limited access with greater success for the GOP.
999;2001;This study examined the relationships between religious orientation and components of religious attitudes. Religious orientation was measured using Batson, Schoenrade, and Ventis' (1993) Religious Life Inventory. Affective, cognitive, and conative components of attitudes toward religious beliefs and practices were measured using an instrument constructed for the study. Participants were undergraduate students from four educational institutions in the United States. Systematic relationships were found among the dimensions of religious orientation and the components of religious attitudes. Means and Quest orientations had very similar profiles, characterized by high Cognition scores and relatively low Affect and Conation scores. By contrast, modestly low Cognition scores and significantly high Affect and Conation scores characterized the profile of the Ends orientation. Results are discussed in terms of the concept of mature religiosity.
1000;2001;This study examined whether the relationships between religious coping and well-being are moderated by the salience of religion to the individual's identity and social roles. As part of a national survey of Presbyterians, 1,260 clergy, 823 elders, and 735 members completed measures of demographic variables, global religiousness, life stressors, positive and negative religious coping, and well-being (positive affect, depressive affect, religious satisfaction). Our predictions were largely confirmed. First, clergy reported higher levels of positive religious coping than elders, who, in turn, indicated more positive religious coping than members. Second, positive and negative religious coping were associated with higher and lower levels of well-being respectively. Finally, positive and negative religious coping were more strongly related to well-being for clergy than for members. Furthermore, the drawbacks of negative religious coping for the clergy were not offset completely by the benefits of positive religious coping. Longitudinal studies of the longer term implications of positive and negative religious coping are clearly warranted. The results also suggest the need for supportive and educational services to help clergy draw on their religious coping resources and come to terms with their spiritual struggles.
1001;2001;"This study examines the recent rash of official reports done by governmental agencies in Western Europe to guide policy development in those societies. Particular attention is given to reports in France, Belgium, Switzerland, Germany, Sweden, and Italy, and to the changes in such reports that have occurred, perhaps because of the influence of scholarly critiques offered for some of the earlier reports. The reports are divided into ""Type I"" and ""Type II"" reports, with the former being thorough-going in their anti-cult orientation, and the latter reports being more moderate in tone, with some attention paid to scholarship on new religions. However, the major thesis of the study is supported, as an examination of both types of reports reveals that they incorporate ""brainwashing"" and ""mind control"" imagery imported from the United States, even though such theories have been largely discounted within the United States. Use of such theories leads directly to some questionable policy recommendations, as demonstrated in the reports. Reasons for the spread of ""brainwashing"" ideas to Europe are discussed."
1002;2001;This study tests three hypotheses derived from Berger's (1967) plausibility theory. The first hypothesis states that among people who attend church frequently, education's liberalizing effect on attitudes toward elective abortion is weakest among conservative Protestants and Catholics, intermediate among moderate Protestants, and strongest among liberal Protestants and Jews. Hypotheses 2 states that education's effect is weaker among frequent than infrequent attenders in all religious groups except liberal Protestants and Jews, and Hypothesis 3 states that education's effect does not vary by religious group among infrequent attenders. Using General Social Survey data, I found strong support for Hypotheses 1 and 2 and partial support for Hypothesis 3. I discuss the implications of the findings for plausibility theory.
1003;2001;Using a survey of three thousand Canadian adults conducted by the Angus Reid Group in the autumn of 1996, we examine the continuing role of religion in shaping partisan preferences. We find that traditional religious alignments still have some impact, but are being reshaped by both religious and political developments. We find that Evangelical Protestants are drawn toward the new Reform Party, Mainline Protestants still tend toward the Progressive Conservatives, and Catholics - both English- and French-speaking - remain the bulwark of the Liberal Party. The New Democratic Party, however, finds its greatest resonance among secular Canadians, and the Bloc Quebecois is strongest among nominal, rather than practicing, French-speaking Catholics. In multivariate analysis, these religious variables stand up well against other influences in explaining partisan preferences.
1004;2001;"Varying religions commitment across generations plays a key role in explaining transitions from sect to church, and the formation of sectarian movements. Within a sect, elite members of younger generations are seen to spur internal secularization that transforms otherworldly sects into world-affirming churches. In this paper I examine how cohort differences in religious commitment across denominations evidence the sect-church transformation process, and point to sources of sect formation among African-Americans. Using data from the 1972-1998 General Social Surveys, I analyze denomination-specific cohort differences in religious participation among African-Americans. Cohort-specific shifts in religious participation across denominations demonstrate the secularization of African-American mainline Methodist and Baptist groups, the continued vitality of sectarian denominations, and the nascent ascendance of ""nondenominational"" churches on the fringes of the religious marketplace."
1005;2005;An important discrepancy seems to exist between self-reports and laboratory studies regarding prosociality among religious people. Some have even suggested that this involves moral hypocrisy on the part of religious people. However, the assumption of the four studies reported here is that the impact of religiousness on prosociality is limited but exists, and does not reflect self-delusion. In Study 1 (N = 106), religious young adults tended not to use indirect aggression in dealing with hypothetical daily hassles. In Study 2 (N = 105), female students' religiosity was associated with willingness to help close targets in hypothetical situations but the effect was not extended to unknown targets. In Studies 3 (N = 315, 105 triads) and 4 (N = 274, 109 targets), religious targets not only reported high altruistic behavior and empathy, but were also perceived as such by peers (friends, siblings, or colleagues) in three out of four cases. Other results from the studies suggested that the prosociality of religious people is not an artifact of gender, social desirability bias, security in attachment, empathy, or honesty.
1006;2005;Based on three principles from theories of human ecology, this study examines the response of downtown churches in metropolitan Columbus, Ohio to a changing environment. Over 150 years, churches grew in number, stabilized, contracted sharply, and restabilized, changing increasingly from neighborhood to niche churches. Better-funded larger and older churches survived by developing heterogeneous religious and other ties with diverse weekday populations of downtown residents, employees, shoppers, and transients. Churches closer to the city center had more opportunities to develop these relationships. Sociological factors such as theology, leadership, and external resources from the metropolis, state, and nation also played a role. The interaction of sociological and ecological frameworks on both macro and micro levels explains the response of religious organizations to specific urban environments.
1007;2005;Current theories can support conflicting accounts of the effects of childhood maltreatment on adult religiosity. However, in the relevant empirical research there are few examples of probability sampling or a focus on nonsexual forms of abuse. It is also uncommon to control for risk factors for abuse, which may themselves also affect adult religiosity. This study attempts to overcome some of these limitations by examining the effects of physical and emotional abuse on adult religiosity and spirituality in a U.S. probability sample of adults at midlife. Neither maltreatment from mothers nor from outside the family has an effect on religiosity, but abuse committed by fathers is related to decreases in religiosity, and abuse from outside the immediate family is related to increases in self-ratings of spirituality. Possible explanation for these results may be related to the image of God as father, which leads victims of abusive fathers to distance themselves from religion.
1008;2005;Does being more religious make one less susceptible to depression? We consider the association between subjective religiosity (religious self-perception and coping) and depression in the context of social support (from family and friends) and stress exposure (recent negative life events, chronic stress, lifetime trauma, and discrimination). Data come from a sample of 1,803 Miami-Dade County young adults interviewed between 1997 and 2000. We find higher levels of depression among the moderately religious than among either very religious or nonreligious respondents. Interestingly, when observations are made within gender, this relationship applies only to females. Controlling for socioeconomic status and social support largely accounts for the link between religiosity and depression. However, controlling for stress exposure reveals a suppressor effect wherein religiosity once again emerges as significant. Our interpretation is that, while established patterns of religious coping can routinely mitigate distress, heightened stress exposure may elicit increased prayer among the less religious.
1009;2005;For years, scholars in religion and politics have worked under the assumption that clergy wield significant political influence with their congregations. Until recently, however, this assumption had gone largely uninvestigated and undemonstrated. This article helps correct this shortcoming by analyzing the Notre Dame Study of Catholic Parish Life for evidence of priestly influence on the political attitudes of Catholic parishioners. Though the data indicate that Catholic priests do, indeed, appear to influence the political attitudes of their parishioners, the nature of this influence is more complex than previously demonstrated. Specifically, pastor ideology is the key predictor of both parishioners' issue positions and political ideology, and influence appears to be restricted to politically liberal pastors.
1010;2005;Iannaccone (1994) uses rational choice theory to argue that strict rules (e.g., no smoking or drinking) raise average commitment levels in conservative churches because strictness discourages free riding. Tests of this assertion have been hampered, in part, by uncertainties concerning how free riding should be measured. We introduce a new, indirect measure of free (and cheap) riding, the level of positive skewness of a congregation's money contributions - that is, the extent to which a few members give much more than the mean amount while the majority gives much less. Using a study of giving in five denominations, we find that strict, conservative congregations have both higher mean giving and less skewness in the pattern of their giving. The higher mean-contribution levels at strict, conservative congregations are not simply due to each member giving more or a few members giving a lot more. Instead, as Iannaccone's model predicts, some combination of strict rules and/or conservative theology appears to systematically limit the proportion of free- and cheap-riding members giving far less than the mean and thus increase the proportion giving at or above the mean.
1011;2005;"In this study, we proposed that people understand major life events in terms of spiritual as well as psychological, social, and physical dimensions. Specifically, we examined the possibility that life events that are perceived to be sacred losses or violations of the sacred (i.e., desecrations) have significant implications for the health and well-being of the individual. A total of 117 adults, randomly selected from a community, identified the most negative life event they had experienced in the past two years. They then completed measures of the degree to which they appraised this event as a sacred loss and as a desecration, as well as measures of religious coping, the impact of the event, and four sets of criteria: traumatic impact, physical health, emotional distress, and growth. These hypotheses were largely supported. Sacred loss and desecration were unrelated to physical health. However, they were tied to higher levels, though somewhat differential patterns, of emotional distress. While sacred loss was predictive of intrusive thoughts and depression, desecration was tied to more intrusive thoughts and greater anger. Furthermore, sacred loss was linked to greater posttraumatic growth and positive spiritual change; in contrast, desecration was associated with less posttraumatic growth. The links between the spiritual appraisals and outcomes were partially mediated by positive and negative methods of religious coping. These findings underscore the importance and multidimensionality of the spiritual meanings people attribute to major life stressors."
1012;2005;Previous research demonstrates two aspects of religion that affect civic activity - church participation and religious conservatism. Conservative religious beliefs and membership in conservative denominations are often associated with low levels of civic activity while church participation is said to increase civic activity. This article advances the discussion of the relationship between religion and civic participation by introducing the congregational context. Data from the 1987 Church and Community Planning Inventory show that congregations vary in their members' civic activity - congregational factors associated with conservative Christianity (high levels of biblical literalism and within-church friendships) are strongly and negatively associated with church members' activity in nonchurch organizations. At the individual level, the data show that education and participation in church activities other than religious services have particularly strong, positive effects on church members' activity in nonchurch organizations. The findings demonstrate that a conservative congregational context limits church members' activity in nonchurch organizations, potentially limiting their opportunities to build heterogeneous social networks and social capital that bridges church members to other people in their communities.
1013;2005;Since colonial times, the United States has been a majority Protestant nation. But the proportion Protestant in the population has been falling for over a decade, and Protestants are poised to lose their majority status. This decline results from a decline in the intergenerational retention rate for Protestants and from the attrition of Protestants among the youngest cohorts. Shifts in immigration also contribute to the Protestant decline. We also consider the role of an increasing share of people identifying as generic Christians and as inter- or nondenominational.
1014;2005;The present study investigated the relation between aspects of religiousness and negative and positive aspects of mental health and compared three models of the psychosocial processes that may underlie this relation. A sample of 668 Jewish Israeli students filled out multidimensional self-report measures of religious belief and behavior, religious identity, personal fear of death, perceived social support, meaning in life, and mental health. This sample was divided into a religious identity subsample, a traditional identity subsample, and a secular identity subsample. Path analyses found religious belief to be positively related to psychosocial well-being and lutgatively related to psycliological distress only for the religious and secular identity subsaniples. These analyses also indicated that meaning in life, but not social support nor fear of death, accounted for both relations.
1015;2005;"There are substantial data exploring the link between religiousness and health, yet there is little consensus regarding the nature of the relationship between religiousness domains and mental health. The purpose of this study was to identify the types of mental health outcomes associated with religiousness domains. Participants included 251 (M = 19.02; range = 17-25) young adults who completed self-report measures of religiousness (Intrinsic, Extrinsic, and Quest Orientations, Faith Maturity Scale), and psychological distress subscales (SCL-90-R). We identified significant relationships between each of the religiousness measures and the SCL-90-R subscales and analyzed the relative contributions of each of the religiousness measures in predicting psychological distress with hierarchical multiple regression. The Faith Maturity Scale was a particularly robust predictor of positive and negative psychological adjustment. The specific pathways by which religiousness influences mental health outcomes remain to be elaborated in future research."
1016;2005;This article compares different discourses of civic responsibility for Korean American evangelicals in a second-generation Korean congregation and a multiethnic congregation located in the same impoverished ethnic minority community. Those in the second-generation church define civic responsibility through difference from immigrant Koreans. They stress caring for members of their local community and explicitly reject their parents' connection of Christianity to economic mobility. Yet, they find relating to other minorities in their local community difficult because of an implicit belief that the economically impoverished are not hardworking. Korean Americans in the multiethnic church connect Christianity to valuing diversity. A religious individualism that is used to justify diversity also helps Korean Americans stress their commonality with other ethnic minorities and legitimates commitment to community service. These results help researchers rethink how new groups of Americans might influence the relationship of evangelical Christianity to American civic life.
1017;2005;This article documents the shift of Falun Gong from a primarily secular healing system to a new religion centering on salvation. Emerging as a qigong organization in China in the early 1990s that provided immediate healing treatments to practitioners, Falun Gong eventually developed into a salvation-oriented religious firm. Mr. Li Hongzhi, the founder of Falun Gong, played a vital role in promoting the movement's transition. Facing the competitive qigong market, Mr. Li decided to differentiate Falun Gong from other competing qigong movements by offering a theory about salvation. He also adopted other organizational and doctrinal mechanisms that are useful in sustaining practitioners and preventing potential schisms. These strategies partly accounted for the growth of Falun Gong in the 1990s. This case study indicates that the religious economy model is helpful in understanding the evolution of Falun Gong, a new religion in contemporary China.
1018;2005;This note replicates a previous study to determine the extent religion influences voting behavior. It focuses on ballot measures that involve moral issues and considers other factors as well. A multiple regression uses the percentage of voters favoring five ballot proposals as the dependent variable, with socioeconomic status, rural isolation, liquor consumption, and three categories of religion as independent variables. The analysis revealed that the religion variables were significant and negatively associated with voting for most proposals that liberalized drinking and betting. Socioeconomic status and liquor consumption were significant in most cases and were positively linked to votes cast for the proposals.
1019;2005;This study used data from a long-term longitudinal study of men and women to examine the relations among spirituality, narcissism, and psychotherapy. The findings indicated that in late adulthood (age late 60s/mid 70s) spirituality was related to autonomous or healthy narcissism but was unrelated to willful (overt) or hypersensitive (covert) narcissism, two pathological forms of the construct. Autonomy in early adulthood (age 30s) was a significant predictor of spirituality in late adulthood (a time interval of close to 40 years) and this relation was mediated by involvement in psychotherapy in midlife. Autonomy was related positively, and hypersensitivity was related negatively, to concern for the welfare of future generations. These findings are discussed in light of current concerns about the social implications of the therapeutic culture.
1020;2005;We analyze the relationship between private prayer and participation in voluntary association. We argue that prayer fosters a cognitive connection to the needs of others, and thus promotes membership in associations that emphasize personal relationships. Private prayer is not related to membership in political groups. The effect of prayer is strengthened by membership in religious groups, suggesting the relevance of both organizational and devotional aspects of religion for civil society participation.
1021;2005;We assess religious differences in attitudes toward physician-assisted suicide and terminal palliative care, and go further than previous research by attempting to explain these variations. Using data from the 1998 General Social Survey, we fit OLS regression models to estimate the main effects of religious affiliation and indirect effects via religious involvement (church attendance and strength of affiliation). Both conservative and moderate Protestants are generally less accepting of physician-assisted suicide and terminal palliative care than nonaffiliates. However, both relationships are at least partially explained by church attendance and/or strength of affiliation.
1022;2005;We evaluate the relation between religiousness and vengeance using multiple indicators of religiousness (religious orientation and church variables) and behavioral as well as self-reports of vengeance. Results from hierarchical regression analyses revealed that intrinsic religious orientation was negatively and extrinsic religious orientation positively related to self-reports of revenge but not to behavioral indicators of revenge. Only quest orientation was related to behavioral indicators of revenge with those higher on quest setting relatively lower levels of shock following a provocation and giving more money to an obnoxious confederate. Of the church variables, the number of religious activities was negatively and frequency of monetary donations positively related to self-reported vengeance. Only frequency of monetary donations, however, was uniquely related to one of the behavioral indicators of revenge, level of shock, with those who give more frequently also retaliating with higher levels of shock.
1023;2005;We explored implicit and explicit attitudes toward Muslims and Christians within a predominantly Christian sample in the United States. Implicit attitudes were assessed with the Implicit Association Test (IAT), a computer program that recorded reaction times as participants categorized names (of Christians and Muslims) and adjectives (pleasant or unpleasant). Participants also completed self-report measures of attitudes toward Christians and Muslims, and some personality constructs known to correlate with ethnocentrism (i.e., right-wing authoritarianism, social dominance orientation, impression management, religious fundamentalism, intrinsic-extrinsic-quest religious orientations). Consistent with social identity theory, participants' self-reported attitudes toward Christians were more positive than their self-reported attitudes toward Muslims. Participants also displayed moderate implicit preference for Christians relative to Muslims. This IAT effect could also be interpreted as implicit prejudice toward Muslims relative to Christians. A slight positive correlation between implicit and explicit attitudes was found. As self-reported anti-Arab racism, social dominance orientation, right-wing authoritarianism, and religious fundamentalism increased, self-reported attitudes toward Muslims became more negative. The same personality variables were associated with more positive attitudes toward Christians relative to Muslims on the self-report level, but not the implicit level.
1024;2006;A growing body of literature finds an inverse association between religiosity and several types of deviant behavior. Although studies of adolescent sexuality form a large part of this literature, it is not clear that their results necessarily pertain to adults. This study examines the relationship between religiosity and the number of sexual partners among never-married adults in pooled samples of the General Social Survey. The major findings indicate that religiosity reduces the number of partners and does so partly because of moral disapproval of premarital sex. Additional analyses address whether the inverse association between religiosity and number of partners varies across gender and race categories. Final remarks address the theoretical importance of the findings and outline areas for further research.  2006 The Society of the Scientific Study of Religion.
1025;2006;Although previous research has found religion to have a significant effect on commune survival, these conclusions were typically based on bivariate analyses. Drawing on data collected by the Fellowship for Intentional Community, we present a multivariate analysis of communal survival using a comparatively large sample (N = 454) of modern American communes. Controlling for key factors suggested by the literature, we find that religion does not have a significant, direct effect on commune survival. Rather, the total population of the commune, whether the commune owned the land, and its longevity significantly influenced survival of a commune between 1995 and 2000. We discuss the implications of these findings for research on the role of religion in communes.  2006 The Society of the Scientific Study of Religion.
1026;2006;Although some scholars have identified religion as a possible protective factor in the AIDS pandemic in sub-Saharan Africa, evidence concerning the relationship between religion and AIDS behavior there remains sparse. Using a sample of married men from rural Malawi, we examine whether AIDS risk behavior and perceived risk are associated with religious affiliation or with religious involvement. Our analyses of data from the Malawi Diffusion and Ideational Change Project (2001) reveal substantial variation according to religious affiliation and religious involvement. Men belonging to Pentecostal churches consistently report lower levels of both HIV risk behavior and perceived risk. Regular attendance at religious services is associated both with reduced odds of reporting extramarital partners and with lower levels of perceived risk of infection.  2006 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1027;2006;"American popular music, politics, and religion have all, in some combination, inspired thorough research. However, there has been little investigative effort regarding the important co-relationships among the three areas. One convenient site for such study is located in the idea of civil religion, where faith and patriotism converge-as Robert Bellah wrote in 1967-in a cultural network of ""beliefs, symbols, and rituals."" This essay offers a contextual examination of two popular patriotic songs in relation to the dynamic state of civil religion from World War II to the Iraq War, from Tin Pan Alley to American Idol. Behind the endurance of songs like ""God Bless America"" and ""God Bless the U.S.A."" lies a relentless need to define Americanness in civil-religious terms. And as the nation, and the nation-state, are reshaped in the currents of globalization, appreciation of these songs contributes to the crucial understanding of why America sings.  2006 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1028;2006;"As part of a larger ethnographic study on the role of religion in the lives of youth in the United States, data collected through fieldwork at Protestant evangelical ministries in the Chicago area show an emerging pattern of marginalized experiences for ""at-risk"" teenaged and college-aged Hispanic females who are involved in youth-based religious groups and activities. We suggest a contradiction emerging from our findings: churches desire to save youth from risky behaviors, thus accommodating their ministries to meet the needs of the at-risk youths; yet, the churches simultaneously promote traditional gender roles that foster feelings of oppression. This forces the young women into a difficult position: Conform and maintain the connectedness to the ministry, or resist the traditional expectations and forfeit what a youth group provides to at-risk youth.  2006 The Society of the Scientific Study of Religion."
1029;2006;Following developmental attachment theory, we predicted a path in which nurturing parents affect young adults' self-concepts and self-esteem, which in turn predicts the image of a nurturing God. To ascertain how images of parents and images of self predict God images, 132 young adults aged 18-22 (M = 19) completed the Tennessee Self-Concept Scale, and a six-item measure of God's perceived involvement in their lives (religiosity scale). In a follow-up interview, they rated their parents, God, and selves on scales of closeness, nurturing, power, and punishing/ judging. For men, mothers were responsible, more than fathers, for creating a climate for sons' self-esteem through nurturance and discipline, which in turn contributed to seeing God as nurturing, feeling close to God, and being more religious. For women, mothers and fathers created a model of nurturance and power, which contributed to seeing God as nurturing and powerful. Punishing/judging parents directly affected punishing/judging God images in these young adults. Men perceived God to be more punishing/judging than did women, while women perceived God to be more nurturing. Even in adulthood, parents, especially mothers, continue to exert influences on young adults' faith and images of God.  2006 The Society of the Scientific Study of Religion.
1030;2006;Free riders can be a problem in large congregations. Many studies have shown that large congregations attract members who are less active and who contribute smaller sums of money. We extend this literature by studying the impact of denominational market share on free-riding behavior. We hypothesize that people who want the benefit of a church affiliation without contributing to its mission may be drawn to the more popular denominations in their region. For example, in an area dominated by Lutherans, membership in a Lutheran congregation may offer potential free riders more social acceptance and connections. However, where Lutherans are in a distinct minority, free riders may perceive less benefit in being Lutheran. If so, only those who are serious about being a Lutheran are likely to join and free-riding behavior should be less evident. Tests using data for the Evangelical Lutheran Church of America (ELCA) congregations are consistent with our hypothesis.  2006 The Society of the Scientific Study of Religion.
1031;2006;Much research has shown that experiences of discrimination are negatively related to mental health. In this study, a national probability survey of whites and African Americans at midlife is used to examine whether attendance at religious services and religious comfort seeking protect people from the effects of discrimination on mental health, and if the protective power of religion varies by race. Results show that reports of discrimination are related to greater negative affect and less positive affect, but only attendance at religious services moderates this relationship, and then only for African Americans' negative affect. The historical involvement of African-American religious bodies in combating discrimination may help to explain the specificity of these moderating effects.  2006 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1032;2006;Personality correlates of implicit and explicit attitudes toward homosexual and heterosexual individuals were examined within a sample of predominantly Protestant college students in the south-central United States. Implicit attitudes were measured with the Implicit Association Test, a computer program that recorded reaction times as participants categorized symbols (of heterosexual individuals and gay men) and adjectives (good or bad words). Participants also completed self-report measures of religious fundamentalism (RF), Christian orthodoxy (CO), right-wing authoritarianism (RWA), impression management (IM), and attitudes toward heterosexuals, gay men, and lesbians. Participants displayed fairly negative implicit and explicit attitudes toward homosexual relative to heterosexual individuals. Consistent with previous research, RF, CO, RWA, and IM were associated with increases in self-reported homosexual prejudice. Religious fundamentalism was the strongest predictor of a negative implicit attitude toward gay men relative to heterosexuals.  2006 The Society of the Scientific Study of Religion.
1033;2006;Preventive health services, such as mammography, play an increasingly important role in maintaining women's health. Social factors, such as religion, may influence utilization rates by expanding access, offering information, and increasing motivation. The current study examines the relationship between religious involvement, religious beliefs, and mammography usage in a nationally representative sample of Presbyterian women (N = 1,070). We use multivariate logistic regression models to estimate the influence of religious service attendance and two health-related religious beliefs on self-reported mammography use. The findings show that religious attendance is significantly associated with mammogram use. Women who attend services nearly every week are almost twice as likely to use mammograms compared to women who attend services less frequently or never. Furthermore, the belief that spiritual health is related to physical health is also associated with the use of mammograms.  2006 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1034;2006;Previous research reveals that religion in America is related to variations in body weight. This article examines the relationships between religion and both body mass index (BMI) and obesity, which have increased in prevalence in the United States over the past two decades. Using longitudinal data from a national sample of adults, this study prospectively examines whether dimensions of religious life are associated with weight gain and the development of obesity during eight years of follow-up. We examine four dimensions of religiosity (attendance, salience, media practice, and consolation) and religious affiliation. Ordinary least squares regression analyses reveal that high levels of religious media practice are associated with higher BMI in women. Logistic regression analyses reveal that high levels of religious media practice and affiliation with a Baptist denomination increased the risk of obesity for women, but that a high level of religious consolation reduced the risk of obesity incidence for men. Attendance at religious services was associated with a lower risk of the incidence of obesity for women, suggesting the importance of studying links between dimensions of religious life and body weight.  2006 The Society of the Scientific Study of Religion.
1035;2006;"Previous research suggests that clergy members are often an initial contact for people seeking advice or social services and clergy often refer such individuals in need to outside agencies. Recent ""faith-based initiatives"" seek to engage churches and religious groups more deeply in social service delivery, potentially changing the mix of organizations to which clergy might refer people in need. In addition, public debates about faith-based social services have drawn attention to religion, often in politically divisive ways. Using semi-structured interviews and vignettes in which key characteristics of outside agencies are experimentally varied, we explore the implications of this heightened attention to religion on clergy referrals. We find that increasing the salience of religion affects clergy referral choices, with some clergy even willing to sacrifice quality care and resources for an individual in need when religious options are available as referral choices. We argue that this occurs at least in part because making religion salient in policy and referrals makes religious differences salient as well.  2006 The Society of the Scientific Study of Religion."
1036;2006;"Recently, quality of life studies among patients with HIV/AIDS have shown high levels of life satisfaction. Spiritual and religious factors may contribute to these positive outcomes. We interviewed 19 patients with HIV/AIDS in order to understand better the role of religious-spiritual biographies and orientations in quality of life, and found four patterns to describe the ways in which past experiences with religion/spirituality and religious/spiritual meaning-making help to explain how patients are currently coping with HIV/AIDS. We illustrate each of these patterns with a prototypic patient: (1) the Deferring Believer (""God allows things to happen for a reason""); (2) the Collaborating Believer (quot;This is where I'm supposed to be""); (3) the Religious/Spiritual Seeker (""I'm trying to get my life together.""); and (4) the Self-Directing Believer (""What else is new?""). The findings support a previously described theoretical model of meaning-making in response to adversity, and they suggest the value of life course and narrative approaches to understanding religious coping.  2006 The Society of the Scientific Study of Religion."
1037;2006;"Reliable and valid measures of religiosity and spiritual dimensions appropriate for ethnically diverse groups are needed. I examine the factor structure of the relatively new Fetzer multidimensional measure (Fetzer Institute 1999). Confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) of national data collected in the 1998 General Social Survey are conducted to (1) test the fit of the proposed dimensionality of the Fetzer measure, specifically comparing the Fetzer structure with a simpler single-factor model suggested by preliminary exploratory factor analyses; and (2) evaluate ethnic differences in factor structure of the Fetzer items. Data from 1,201 adults, 1,019 whites and 182 African Americans, are examined to compare the fit of the multidimensional Fetzer model against an alternative single-factor (""unitary spirituality"") model. CFA analyses indicated that only the Fetzer models had acceptable fit indices (NFI and/or NNFI approaching or reaching 0.90). Ethnic differences in loadings, while significant, were not substantively different. These findings suggest that a multidimensional measure like the Fetzer is useful for multiethnic research and that combining the daily spirituality and values/beliefs dimensions into a single factor provides a simpler model overall (compared to the Fetzer model separating these dimensions out) while providing acceptable fit.  2006 The Society of the Scientific Study of Religion."
1038;2006;"Religion provides an important basis for social integration and the prevention of deviant behavior, such as tax fraud, a crime that costs society billions of dollars in lost revenue. The literature on tax fraud and tax fraud acceptability (TFA) has neglected religiosity as a social bond that may deter this type of behavior. Furthermore, existing work is based on the United States; there are no systematic cross-national studies. In particular, there is no research exploring the ""moral communities"" hypothesis that religiosity's effect on deviance will vary according to the strength of national moral communities. The present study addresses these two gaps in the literature by analyzing data on 45,728 individuals in 36 nations from the World Values Surveys. We control for other predictors of TFA, including social bonds, economic strain, and demographic factors. The results determined that the higher the individual's level of religiosity, the lower the TFA. Results on the moral community's hypothesis were mixed. However, in a separate analysis of individual nations, the presence of a ""moral community"" (majority of the population identifies with a religious group) explained 39 percent of the variation in the presence or absence of the expected religiosity-TFA relationship. Furthermore, the presence of a communist regime in a nation, often known for the oppression of religious groups who then may view the regime as illegitimate, diminished the impact of religion on TFA.  2006 The Society of the Scientific Study of Religion."
1039;2006;Research on the relationship between religion and crime has typically focused on individual religiosity and delinquency, or moral communities and crime at the macro level. This study extends prior research by delineating the sociological implications of a strong religious institutional base, and investigating the ties between the religious institutional base and violent crime across rural communities. Multivariate regression analysis of Uniform Crime Report data on violent crime, Census of Churches and Church membership data, and U.S. Census data circa 2000 reveal that rural violent crime rates on average are consistently lower where there are more churches per capita. This relationship holds net of the overall adherence rates, the presence of civically engaged religious adherents, and the presence of conservative Protestant adherents. Moreover, regional variations are evident, with the South and the Midwest - two highly religious regions of the country - sustaining most of the observed institutional effects.  2006 The Society of the Scientific Study of Religion.
1040;2006;Setting its discussion in the wider context of the decline of institutional religion among young adults, the rise of alternative spiritualities, and the mediatization of religion, the article explores the significance of popular music in the development of alternative spiritual identities and ideologies. A summary is given of leading research conducted in this field by Christopher Partridge and Graham St. John. It is argued that they demonstrate the encoding of alternative spiritual symbols and ideologies into certain forms of popular music, they fail to give an adequate account of how audiences actively make use of this music to construct alternative spiritual identities or frameworks of meaning. The article concludes that researchers in the field of religion and popular music need to draw more on theories and methods developed in ethno-musicology and the sociology of music, and suggests that the work of Tia De Nora on music in everyday life raises important questions about the qualities and context of the act of listening to music that could generate more nuanced accounts of how popular music shapes alternative spiritual identities and ideologies.  2006 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1041;2006;Some of the most contentious issues in American religion today concern homosexuality. In 1998, we asked 2,300 clergy in the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) and the Episcopal Church whether their denomination should adopt official statements on homosexuality. A year later, we asked the same question of 1,600 church members in 60 of those clergy's congregations. In this research note, we analyze the attitudes of clergy and church members about beginning the process to compose formal denominational statements on homosexuality. We find great differences between the two denominations, reflecting established conflict in the Episcopal Church and a lack thereof in the ELCA. The attitudes of both clergy and church members, shaped by denominational context, reflect their general attitudes toward gay rights and the public involvement of the denomination. Clergy exhibit particular concern about how a denominational statement might affect their own congregation, and church members take significant cues from their clergy.  2006 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1042;2006;The 2001 population census in Scotland - the first to include questions on religion - provides important evidence on religious mobility and the effect of local context on religious disaffection. The amount of denominational switching is small both in absolute terms and relative to the incidence of complete defection. The trend toward disaffiliation dates from before World War II, but religious decline has been especially steep since the 1960s. While there are important geographical variations in religious adherence, the absolute size of the swing to no religion has been quite uniform across the country. These approximately constant reductions in affiliation imply, somewhat counterintuitively, the existence of neighborhood differences, with denominational identification being most likely to wane in areas where the denomination is weak. No association was found between the proportion of the local population affiliated with a religious group and the level of participation in that denomination.  2006 The Society of the Scientific Study of Religion.
1043;2006;The first nationally representative study of spiritual transformations documents that spiritual/religious change is a common and powerful experience in America. About half of all adult Americans report having had such an experience. Such change is strongly related to current religious beliefs and behaviors, but shows little relationship to most nonreligious demographics. A series of open-ended items indicates that the leading causes of spiritual/religious change are normal religious activity and having had a serious personal problem, most often an illness or accident to oneself or someone close or the death of someone close. A strengthening of faith is the most common consequence of this experience. This is followed by changes in character (e.g., being more understanding, helpful) and the stopping of perceived bad habits (e.g., drinking, partying). The lasting importance of such spiritual/religious change is also shown by closed-ended measures and the predictive power that the variable has in explaining various beliefs and behaviors even when controlling for other religious variables.  2006 The Society of the Scientific Study of Religion.
1044;2006;"The term ""cult"" has attracted much criticism from several sociologists of religion and religious studies scholars in recent years, and many scholars have dropped the word for a less pejorative term such as ""new religious movement"" (NRM). This research note seeks to determine if simply substituting an alternative term for cult changes people's attitudes toward a religious group. To this end, over 2,400 randomly selected Nebraskans were asked how comfortable they would feel if their neighbor joined a cult, NRM, or a ""new Christian church,"" and whether the government should regulate the activities of these groups. The survey results reveal the remarkably negative view Nebraskans have of cults, their general acceptance of NRMs, and their broad support for new Christian churches.  2006 The Society of the Scientific Study of Religion."
1045;2006;Theory in the sociology of religion suggests that a prerequisite for cooperative coalitions among religious groups on political matters is a decline in sectarianism. In analyses of survey data I show that sectarianism has receded for the religious left but not the religious right. Groups that would comprise the religious right are less likely to want the other conservative religious groups to have an influence on public opinion, while groups on the left are less opposed to other liberal groups having influence. It is particularly clear that conservative Protestants are wary of the influence of Catholics. I also conduct exploratory analyses to examine who, among the members of the religious groups who would comprise the religious right, is more sectarian. I find that while demographics are largely nondeterminative, those who are supportive of religiously-based politics are the least sectarian.  2006 The Society of the Scientific Study of Religion.
1046;2006;"This article analyzes the best available evidence from the major British social surveys to describe and explain the continuous decline of religion throughout the 20th century. This decline is overwhelmingly generational in nature rather than a product of particular periods such as World War II or the 1960s. Measures of religious affiliation, regular attendance at worship, and religious belief show nearly identical rates of intergenerational decline. Decline has not been offset by any positive age effects in an aging society: Britons do not get more religious as they get older. The intergenerational decline follows clear patterns of transmission of parental religious characteristics to children. Two potential modulators of decline are identified and investigated: immigration of people who are more religious than the existing population and higher fertility rates among the religiously active population. Of these only the former appears of importance. The nonwhite ethnic minority immigrant population is far more religious than the white population; however, the rates of intergenerational decline (between immigrant parents and native-born children) are almost as high as for the white population, leading to an intergenerational convergence of levels of religiosity. Although ethnic minority populations tend to be more religious and have higher fertility rates, there is no differential fertility by religiosity among the population as a whole.  2006 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1047;2006;"This article evaluates complementary perspectives on the relationship between religion and alcohol among Hispanics. In particular, it examines whether religion may be related to alcohol consumption through two mechanisms, one deriving primarily from doctrinally specific norms, and the other a denominationally independent effect of social integration. The basic premise is that these mechanisms may operate in relative independence. Thus, the article argues that in a fully specified model, variations in alcohol use that are associated with prohibitive norms can be distinguished from those that are associated with membership in a religious community (irrespective of its alcohol norms). The former effect is unique to members of Protestant denominations that object to the use of alcohol; the latter also accrues to the Catholics. A separate, exploratory analysis looks at whether these effects differ by gender. The results indicate that both mechanisms reduce the likelihood of alcohol consumption, but that the doctrinally specific normative one is more powerful. Furthermore, it appears that alcohol-use norms are more salient for men than for women, although the findings are not as robust as expected.  2006 The Society of the Scientific Study of Religion."
1048;2006;"This article explores how religion shapes civic cultures through a cross-national study of voluntary association membership. I adopt a multi-level approach to examine the influence of religion at both individual and country level. First, I hypothesize that Protestants are more likely than Catholics to hold voluntary association membership. Second, I hypothesize that Protestant nations have a higher overall membership rate compared to Catholic nations. Third, I investigate if secularization has reduced individual-level Catholic-Protestant differences in voluntary association membership within a nation. I test the hypotheses using hierarchical nonlinear models with individual-level and country-level data from 29 nations. The findings show that Protestants are more likely than Catholics to be members of voluntary associations, while there is no difference between Protestants and those who belong to ""Other"" or no religions. At the same time, Catholic nations have lower overall membership rates compared to Protestant nations. The results can be interpreted as a ""double negative"" Catholic effect. Finally, the effect of secularization on Catholic-Protestant differences is statistically nonsignificant.  2006 The Society of the Scientific Study of Religion."
1049;2006;"This article explores the issue of gender, feminism, and religion through a study of Jewish Israeli traditionalist (masorti) women. Based on the premise that feminist discourse and rhetoric have become widely accepted and disseminated (while sociocultural and political practices are far from fully implementing this discourse), the article asks how women who choose an identity that refuses to fall into the one-dimensional dichotomy that distinguishes between the category of the ""secular-modern-feminist"" and that of the ""religious-traditional-subordinate"" construct and negotiate their feminine identity, while exploring the varying ways in which this identity-construct interplays with these women's identity as members of an ethno-national collective. This exploration deals with issues of: feminist and Jewish traditionalist discourses; body, dress, and ritual; family, spousal relations, and personal security; and women in synagogue.  2006 The Society of the Scientific Study of Religion."
1050;2006;"This article uses a Scottish national sample to examine the relationship between church involvement, religious socialization among nonattenders, orthodox Christian beliefs, and a variety of unconventional nonmaterialist beliefs. Greater conventional religious belief is strongly associated with supposed alternatives but nonetheless, nonattenders are more likely to believe in the unconventional over and above any enduring sympathy they may hold for Christian doctrine. One group in particular stands out: belief remains high among nonattenders who once went to services regularly and seriously contemplate reengaging with organized religion. The article discusses the importance of these findings for ""believing but not belonging.""  2006 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1051;2006;This essay considers why studying ecstatic religious parctices that include music as an integral component of trance and possession performance might be productive for sociologists, praticularly in the context of globalization. As spirit possession practices become connected with global markets, and as specific musical genres associated with trance are reinterpreted within secular frameworks (Indo-Pakistani Sufi qawwali singing and Afro-Cuban Ocha batdrumming, for example), ecstatic religious contexts, and decreasing emphasis is placed on the culturally specific locales from which these performance practices emerge. Why are self-identified nonbelievers interested in consuming musical genres that have their origins in ecstatic religious practices? What do these commodified and recontextualized ecstatic religious practices provide the people who consume them?.  2006 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1052;2006;"This research note examines patterns of denominational switching and the characteristics of switchers within Judaism in the United States. Viewing orthodox, conservative, and reform Judaism and a fourth ""nonspecific""group as categories that range from the most traditional to the least traditional, respectively, we focus on the movement of individuals toward or away from a more traditional denomination in comparison with remaining in the same denomination in which they were raised. The data were drawn from the National Jewish Population Survey (NJPS) 2000-2001 (NJPS 2003). We found that 62 percent stay within the same group, 29 percent move away from tradition, and 9 percent move to a more traditional denomination. Multivariate logistic regression analyses show that a lower level of Jewish background, higher previous travel to Israel, a greater extent of organizational affiliation, and a higher level of spiritual feelings and beliefs are associated with moving to a more traditional denomination whereas a higher level of Jewish background, lower previous travel to Israel, and a lower level of spiritual feelings and beliefs are associated with moving to a less traditional denomination. In addition, a few sociodemographic factors (previously married, has a child at home, lives in a western state) are associated with movement toward tradition whereas others (older age, female, not living in the northeast or west) are associated with movement in the other direction.  2006 The Society of the Scientific Study of Religion."
1053;2006;This study examines race and socioeconomic status (SES) differences in levels of the sense of divine control and its association with psychological distress. Using data from adults aged 65 and older in the District of Columbia and two adjoining counties in Maryland, we document that levels of the sense of divine control are highest among African Americans and individuals of low SES. Although the association between SES and perceived divine control is more negative among whites net of statistical adjustments for other indicators of religiosity and stressors, these conditions contribute modestly to the race  SES interaction effect. In addition, the sense of divine control is associated negatively with distress among low-SES African Americans and positively with distress among low-SES white elders. These patterns remain stable net of other forms of religiosity, an array of stressors, and the personal resources of the sense of mastery and self-esteem. Our findings elaborate on social stratification differences in religiosity and their different associations with well-being.  2006 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1054;2006;This study examines the relationship between Black Church involvement in social and racial justice issues and support for women in the pastorate, using Faith Factor 2000 national data for seven denominations and bivariate and logistic regression analyses. Findings suggest that involvement in social activism does not necessarily correlate positively with support for women as pastors. Although frequent sermonic focus on Black Liberation and Womanist theology, and clergy involvement in protest efforts, engender such support, sermonic focus on general issues of racial justice actually undermine support for women in the pastorate. These findings have important implications for efforts toward increased gender equity in the Black Church tradition.  2006 The Society of the Scientific Study of Religion.
1055;2006;"This study examines the religious affiliation and participation of immigrants from a large-scale, comparative perspective. I propose a ""specific migration"" framework, in which immigrants' religiosity is an outcome of both individual characteristics and contextual properties related to immigrants' country of origin, country of destination, and combinations of origin and destination (i.e., communities). I use notions discussed in the religion and migration literature that fit into this scheme. To test these ideas, I collected and standardized 20 existing surveys on immigrants in eight Western countries, yielding about 38,000 immigrants. Applying multilevel models, I found, among other things, that: (1) immigrants from countries with higher levels of modernization express lower levels of religious commitment; (2) immigrants in religious countries are more religious themselves; and (3) the well-documented higher levels of religious commitment among women is not generalizable to immigrants.  2006 The Society of the Scientific Study of Religion."
1056;2006;"This study provides support for a model that conceptualizes prayers as the means to establish cognitive connections in three directions: Inward (self-connection); outward (human-human connection); and upward (human-divine connections). A confirmatory factor analysis demonstrates a single general prayer factor divisible into three subfactors that are in turn comprised of eight discrete scales. Measures of general religiosity, the need for structure, religious styles of coping, well-being, life-satisfaction, and belief in the paranormal provide evidence of convergent and divergent validity for the theory of prayer as a mechanism for inward, outward, and upward connections.  2006 The Society of the Scientific Study of Religion."
1057;2006;Two important theories of religiosity are the secularization hypothesis and the religion-market model. According to the former, sometimes called a demand-side theory, economic development reduces religious participation and beliefs. According to the latter, described as a supply-side theory, religiosity depends on the presence of a state religion, regulation of the religion market, suppression of organized religion under Communism, and the degree of religious pluralism. We assess the theories by using survey information for 68 countries over the last 20 years, measuring attendance at formal religious services, religious beliefs, and self-identification as religious. In accordance with the secularization view, overall economic development - represented by per capita GDP - tends to reduce religiosity. Moreover, instrumental estimates suggest that this link reflects causation from economic development to religiosity, rather than the reverse. The presence of an official state religion tends to increase religiosity, probably because of the subsidies that flow to organized religion. However, in accordance with the religion-market model, religiosity falls with government regulation of the religion market and Communist suppression. Greater religious pluralism raises attendance at formal services but has no significant effects on religious beliefs or self-identification as religious. Although religiosity declines overall with economic development, the nature of the interaction varies with the dimension of development. For example, religiosity is positively related to education and the presence of children and negatively related to urbanization.  2006 The Society of the Scientific Study of Religion.
1058;2006;Within the past 15 years, sociological studies of religion have emphasized the chosen, achieved nature of religious identities and have deemphasized ascription or tribalism as the basis of Americans' construction of religious selves. The accounts many people develop in narrating their religious life experiences, however, often combine notions of ascription and achievement in ways scholars have not clearly conceptualized. This article develops an approach to religious identity that shows how, rather than being treated as a dichotomy, the concepts of ascription and achievement are integrated in nuanced ways in the narratives of religious identity told by first-generation immigrant Thai Buddhists and third-generation Jews, two groups with strong inherited religious identities. The comparison between Jews and Buddhists shows how members of both groups blend the concepts of ascription and achievement in similar and different ways, particularly around practice, regardless of their participation in religious organizations.  2006 The Society of the Scientific Study of Religion.
1059;2007;Advances in new reproductive genetic technologies have spawned a very polarized public and political debate. As with the abortion debate, most formal opposition to these technologies comes from religious organizations that are concerned about embryonic and fetal life. In this article we conduct an analysis of the first nationally representative opinion survey on religion and reproductive genetics. We find, as in the abortion debate, that evangelicals, fundamentalists, and traditionalist Catholics are more opposed than more liberal religious groups. When we compare respondents with the same views on embryonic life, we find that differences remain in the level of approval for genetic technologies, suggesting that there is more to this debate than concern about embryos. We also find that religious conservatives are more distinct from the religious nonattenders in their views of health objectives of reproductive genetic technologies and less distinct in their views of improvement objectives.  2007 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1060;2007;As citizens of the most technologically advanced and economically developed country in the world, nearly all Americans stalwartly maintain their faith in God, much more so than residents of other postindustrial countries (Norris and Ingelhart 2004). But what is the content and meaning of this belief?Perhaps belief in God has become so pervasive in contemporary American culture that it reflects little about believers' deeper religious thoughts, identities, and actions. We find the opposite to be true. Outside the confines of seminaries, competing beliefs about who God is and what God wants have a clear and important connection to everyday religious life in the United States. Subtle distinctions in American images of God powerfully predict religious diversity as measured by belief in the truth of a single religious faith, religious devotion, and attitudes about the compatibility of secular and religious spheres. More specifically, we discern that American religious conservatism, in all its forms, can be aptly characterized by the belief that God is highly engaged in the world and particularly judgmental of human behavior.  2007 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1061;2007;As faculty become defined more by the professional norms of their discipline, the potential for conflict with the faith-based norms of religious colleges and universities should increase. Survey responses from over 1,900 faculty at six religious colleges and universities show that most faculty members support including religious criteria in hiring, contrary to professional, disciplinary norms, but most faculty reject religious constraints on academic freedom, conforming to professional norms. These seemingly conflicting positions are reconciled by a high level of commitment to the integration of faith and learning.  2007 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1062;2007;"Based on observations and interviews in two churches representing two different strands of American Protestantism, I assess the ways in which children contribute to the social construction of class, culture, and religious identity for adults. Evidence comes from observing how congregations incorporate children into adult worship services and talk about them in texts and programs, and from the ways in which newer and long-term congregation members describe valuing and understanding children's ministries. These styles and their meanings reflect the history, heritage, and theological distinctives of these two strands of American Protestantism. Religion, I suggest, is not just good for children; children themselves are a religious resource whose presence in worship, service, and discourse helps to create and maintain a sense of identity, place, and meaning in the lives of worshipping adults.  2007 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1063;2007;"Drawing on religious coping theory, we examined whether the appraisal that Jews desecrate Christian values (the stressor) is linked to anti-Semitic attitudes (the response). Further, we considered whether religious ways of understanding and dealing with this stressor (religious coping) mitigate or exacerbate the ties between religious appraisals of Jews and anti-Semitic responses. College students completed measures of desecration, anti-Semitism, and religious ways of coping with appraisals of Jews as desecrators of Christianity. Greater desecration was associated with greater anti-Semitism, after controlling for demographic variables and dispositional measures (e.g., particularism, pluralism, church attendance, Christian orthodoxy, fundamentalism, and authoritarianism). Religious coping in ways that emphasized expressions of Christian love were associated with lower anti-Semitism; ways of coping that emphasized being punished by God and Jews as demonic were tied to greater anti-Semitism. Perceptions of Jews as desecrators were predicted by higher levels of authoritarianism and religious orthodoxy, less closeness to Jews, greater exposure to messages of desecration, and less exposure to messages that counter the perception of desecration.  2007 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1064;2007;In recent decades, homosexuality has emerged as a truly national political issue. As a result, the U.S. Congress is increasingly called upon to consider and set policy on an array of issues related to the status of gay men and lesbians. This article investigates legislator decision making pertaining to gay issues in the U.S. House of Representatives. Specifically, we examine the effect of several indicators on legislator support for progressive gay policies, including ideology, partisanship, and the characteristics of district religious affiliation. We use additive indices of legislator support for progressive gay policies, and use logit and ordered logit to derive estimates of influence. The findings indicate that even while legislator partisanship and ideology largely structure decision making, legislators are also highly responsive to the presence of conservative Protestants and (to a lesser extent) Roman Catholics in their constituency.  2007 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1065;2007;"In this study, residents of Kyto's Gion Festival ""float-cart neighborhoods"" reveal how ritual participation yields a strong sense of community, and this is connected with several forms of social support. By applying the theory of ritual practice to qualitative research conducted in 2003, I examine how some of the main participants in this month of rites and festivities gain a sense of belonging and emotional support based on their roles in this historically and culturally significant shrine-related festival. Specifically, highly involved male participants form intimate and exclusive relationships and develop enduring networks that offer feelings of unity and spiritual guidance. With a combination of well-accepted ""Western"" theories and methods, and an understanding of distinct cultural differences, I explore how involvement in a major Japanese religious festival is positively associated with a sense of community and lasting social support.  2007 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1066;2007;"One of the most significant phenomena in organized religion over the past two decades is the development and growth of the ""megachurch."" While these dramatically large campuses and congregations represent a relatively new aspect of religious life in the United States, they are already having a profound effect on the way in which Americans worship through their size and often their wealth. Given their size and increasing numbers, where they are located takes on a special significance. We assess their location within the context of a range of demographic and economic factors in those states in which they are most prevalent.  2007 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1067;2007;"Over the past several decades, survey research has found a growing percentage of Americans claiming no religious affiliation. In this article, we introduce a modified religious traditions (RELTRAD) typology to measure religious affiliation. The approach benefits from a more detailed data collection and coding scheme of religious tradition based upon religious family, denomination, and congregation. Using new national survey data from the Baylor Religion Survey, we find: (1) improvement to survey design and measurement makes it possible to accurately locate more Americans within established religious traditions; (2) Americans remain connected to congregations, but less so to denominations or more generic religious identity labels; and (3) religious adherents are considerably more evangelical than prior studies have found. Finally, we consider how affiliation as a form of religious belonging relates to religious beliefs and behaviors.  2007 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1068;2007;Recent research on the connection between religion and environmental concern and activism has led to divergent conclusions, with some studies finding a negative effect of religious factors, and others finding no influence or a positive effect. Using a conceptual apparatus of structuration theory, we explain how these divergent findings might be reconciled. We examine data from the 1993 General Social Survey to elaborate how religious affiliation, participation, and beliefs influence environmental concern and private and political environmental activism. Estimates from structural equation models are presented to show the sometimes competing direct and indirect effects of religious affiliation, participation, and beliefs on environmental concern and private and political environmental action.  2007 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1069;2007;"Religion as a social form is constructed to provide adherents with a sense of empowerment and control. Rituals that involve a risk of physical or psychological injury or even death therefore would appear anomalous and indeed are frequently the objects of social scientific and journalistic denigration. Firewalking and serpent handling exemplify such rituals. I argue that these two radical ritual practices, which I term spiritual edgework, provide a valuable sociological window on how radical ritual practices are socially constructed. The social construction process involves the identification of a mythically relevant edge that offers: both contingency and certainty; individual and collective preparation for the impending edgework during which tensions are elevated for later ritual resolution; a ritualized process for successfully navigating the edge; and postedgework accounts that neutralize potential disconfirming injuries or deaths.  2007 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1070;2007;Religious coping may or may not be adaptive depending upon whether such coping is positive or negative. We investigated the potential moderating effects of positive and negative religious coping patterns on the relationship between negative life events and psychological functioning. Questionnaires included measures of negative life events, positive and negative religious coping, and psychological functioning, and were completed by 336 adult, Protestant church members. Even after controlling for religious participation, negative events were related to increased use of positive and negative religious coping and decreased psychological functioning. Moreover, negative events and positive religious coping produced an interaction effect on depression, such that the high use of positive religious coping buffered the deleterious effects of negative events.  2007 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1071;2007;Since Niebuhr's seminal work on the social sources of denominationalism, nearly all research on the relationship between social class and religious affiliation has focused on the denominational (or individual) level of analysis. This research examines the effects of social class at the congregational level - effects that were previously glossed over by a unit of analysis that was too large. After demonstrating the relative strength of social class at the denominational and congregational level, I argue that our theoretical attempts to link class and religious affiliation must include congregational-level explanations.  2007 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1072;2007;The aim of the current study was to determine whether components of executive functioning and two diverging aspects of religiosity (scriptural literalism and quest) are significant predictors of postconventional moral reasoning. An additional goal of the study was to determine whether components of executive functioning moderate the relationship between religiosity and postconventional moral reasoning. Postconventional moral reasoning was assessed using the Defining Issues Test, Version 2 (DIT2), which is primarily based on Lawrence Kohlberg's model. Results indicated that components of executive functioning, along with quest, were significant predictors of postconventional moral reasoning and were significantly correlated with each other. In addition, analyses demonstrated that the relationship between quest and postconventional moral reasoning was moderated by performance on the Comprehension subtest of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, 3rd ed. (WAIS-III), a measure assessing social awareness and general reasoning.  2007 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1073;2007;"The recent growth of Pentecostal Protestantism in Latin America has called attention to the social consequences of religious conversion. Ethnographic studies find that affiliation with Pentecostal churches is associated with attitudinal and behavioral transformations that modify gender relations, enhance the economic viability of the household, and endow families with social capital that can be mobilized during periods of economic stress, sickness, and emergency. The nature of the changes suggests that they may improve the welfare of infants and young children within the family. To explore this proposition, we use sample data from the 2000 demographic census in the Brazilian northeast to estimate the probability of death among children born to women 20 to 34 years of age. The findings show that, other things being equal, the death rate among children born to Protestant women is around 10 percent lower compared to the death rate among children born to Catholic women. We further disaggregate Protestants into ""traditional"" (e.g., Baptist, Presbyterian) and ""Pentecostal"" (e.g., Assembly of God) subgroups, and show that the mortality-reducing effect is greater among historical compared to Pentecostal Protestants. No mortality effects were associated with membership in neo-Pentecostal churches.  2007 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1074;2007;"The relationship between personal religiousness and substance abuse treatment outcomes has emerged as an important issue in the public health arena. Using the ""moral community"" perspective, a conceptual framework developed by Stark, Kent, and Doyle (1982) to analyze the contextual effects of religion, we explore the degree to which religion influences two drug treatment outcome measures - critical retention and commitment to treatment. The data are derived from the Drug Abuse Treatment Outcome Studies (DATOS), a national study of 10,010 clients enrolled in 70 drug treatment programs. Three research questions were addressed: (1) What is the relationship between an individual's level of religiosity and retention in treatment and commitment to treatment? (2) How does the ecological context of treatment programs shape the individual-level relationships? (3) To what extent are program practices and characteristics directly linked to outcome level?The findings are supportive of the literature that shows a weak to moderate relationship between religiosity and treatment outcomes. However, the findings did not show strong support for the ""moral community"" hypothesis. Although there was a wide variation in the size of the individual-level religiosity-treatment correlations, the variation could not be conclusively attributed to the overall religious emphasis of the programs. The findings suggest that further research is needed in order to understand fully the role of religion in substance abuse treatment.  2007 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1075;2007;"This article examines an important and understudied part of the sociological study of religion: Consumption of religious materials. We use data from the Baylor Religion Survey and present an initial look at which Americans read the Left Behind series, viewed The Passion of the Christ, or purchased religious paraphernalia such as ""What Would Jesus Do"" bracelets. Drawing on cultural consumption and religious capital research we explore class, demographic, and religious influences on consumption patterns. We find some support for each of these perspectives, which suggests that religious consumption is not a subset of cultural consumption nor of religious practice but is some combination of both.  2007 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1076;2007;This article outlines a new approach to the study of religious commitment. Starting with a variant on Schelling's classic model of mobility and segregation, we develop a multi-agent religion simulation (MARS) that incorporates insights from theories of religious choice, social influence, and preference formation. Compared to standard statistical methods, MARS does a better job of linking individual choices and collective outcomes. In particular, it demonstrates that stable regional patterns require a balanced combination of attachment to personal identity and adaptation to the social environment.  2007 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1077;2007;"This article uses data from the World Values Survey to study the spread of post-Christian spirituality (""New Age"") in 14 Western countries (1981-2000, N = 61,352). It demonstrates that this type of spirituality, characterized by a sacralization of the self, has become more widespread during the period 1981-2000 in most of these countries. It has advanced farthest in France, Great Britain, the Netherlands, and Sweden. This spiritual turn proves a byproduct of the decline of traditional moral values and hence driven by cohort replacement. Spirituality's popularity among the well educated also emerges from the latter's low levels of traditionalism. These findings confirm the theory of detraditionalization, according to which a weakening of the grip of tradition on individual selves stimulates a spiritual turn to the deeper layers of the self.  2007 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1078;2007;This study assessed the consensual stereotypes religious students have of the nonreligious. The stereotype's content, subtypes, subtype strengths, and valence were examined using multiple methods derived from the stereotype content literature. Results indicated that the nonreligious stereotype is diverse and that some impressions of nonreligious people may be quite negative. Six subtypes were identified within the principal stereotype. The most unfavorable subtype was related to a perceived disbelief in religion and spirituality. The most favorable subtype was associated with individualism.  2007 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1079;2007;This study considers the impact of having parents of dissimilar faiths on children's well-being. Using data from the National Survey of Families and Households, we examine the hypothesis that parents' religious heterogamy has both direct and indirect negative effects on children's well-being. First, we find evidence that religious heterogamy is positively associated with marital conflict and negatively associated with religious participation. Second, our results suggest that children with religiously heterogamous parents are more likely to engage in marijuana use and underage drinking than children with religiously homogamous parents. However, these associations occur only in families where parents' religious heterogamy is a product of greater religious distance (e.g., one parent is not religious or both parents identify with different religions). Religiously heterogamous parents who affiliate with different Protestant groups report similar levels of marital conflict and religious participation as same-faith parents. In addition, the children of these parents report similar levels of delinquency as children of same-faith parents. We find no evidence that religious heterogamy is associated with children's self-esteem, life satisfaction, or grades in school.  2007 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1080;2007;This study examines the relationships among race, education, formal as well as informal involvement in the church, and God-mediated control. Formal involvement in the church was assessed by the frequency of attendance at worship services, Bible study groups, and prayer groups. Informal involvement was measured with an index of spiritual support provided by fellow church members. Data from a nationwide longitudinal survey of older people suggest that both formal and informal church involvement tend to sustain feelings of God-mediated control over time. The findings further reveal that compared to older whites, older African Americans are more likely to have stronger feelings of God-mediated control at the baseline survey and older blacks are more likely to sustain their sense of God-mediated control over time. In contrast, the data suggest that education is not significantly related to feelings of God-mediated control.  2007 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1081;2007;This study represents an attempt to operationalize and validate the civil religion concept on four different national samples. The cultural heritage of these countries varies greatly, and according to Samuel Huntington's (1994) classification, they belong to three different civilizations. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were used to confirm the statistical adequacy of a proposed civil religion scale at the national and at the cross-cultural level. Civil religion proved to be a separate dimension from general religiosity, as well as from traditionalism, both at the cross-cultural and at the national level, although closely linked to these. Of the latter two background variables, civil religion proved to be linked more to traditionalism.  2007 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1082;2007;Three studies examined the ways in which cognitive appraisals of health and the condition of the body use moral discourse derived from Christianity. Study 1 indicated that people explicitly rated health-related behaviors such as exercising and dieting as more pious and less sinful than their negative counterparts. Studies 2 and 3 elaborated upon these results using the Implicit Association Test, a cognitive procedure for examining automatic (or implicit) associations that may exist outside of conscious awareness. Results indicated that people have a strong implicit association between morality and the condition of the body. Furthermore, this implicit association remained significant once potential overlap with standard evaluative terminology was statistically controlled. These results suggest that people implicitly evaluate the condition of the body using moral discourse, and that the use of such rhetoric reflects the cognitive appraisal of obesity as immoral, rather than as simply negative in a standard sense.  2007 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1083;2007;Using event history analysis of 849 adults raised Catholic, this research note examines effects of attending Catholic elementary school and high school on the likelihood one remains Catholic. Attending Catholic high school for at least three years significantly reduces the likelihood that one disaffiliates from Catholicism, reducing both the likelihood that one converts to another faith and the likelihood that one chooses to have no religion at all. Additional analyses show that Catholic high school has no significant effect on adult Mass attendance when considering respondents who are currently Catholic. But when analyses include all respondents raised Catholic, Catholic high school produces a positive effect on attendance. This may help explain seemingly conflicting findings in the literature on Catholic schooling and religious commitment.  2007 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1084;2007;"Using the Philadelphia Congregations Census, the Neighborhood Change Database, the U.S. Census, and geographic information systems (GIS) software, this study compared characteristics of congregations made up of members who live nearby their congregation's building to those with more members who commute from outside the immediate area or outside the city. We considered whether the neighborhood characteristics in which the ""commuter"" versus ""resident"" congregations were located differed in regard to racial composition, socioeconomic status, and residential stability. The study found that where the pastor lives in relation to the building, denomination, racial composition of membership, and the stability of the neighborhood were related to members' residential proximity to the congregation building.  2007 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1085;2007;"We examine whether religious membership and participation foster community volunteerism among a religiously diverse group of Asian Americans. We use data from the Social Capital Community Benchmark Survey (SCCBS), the only data set that contains both a large, national sample of Asian Americans and detailed questions on religious and civic participation. Asian-American Protestants, Catholics, and adherents of non-Christian religions are involved in community volunteerism to varying degrees. Surprisingly, however, fewer Hindus and Buddhists volunteer when compared to the nonaffiliated. We use these results to propose theoretical concepts that take into account the impact of a religion's structure as well as the double-minority status faced by nonwhite and non-Christian Asian Americans on the likelihood of volunteering. Our findings indicate that accepted predictors of community volunteerism may operate differently among new nonwhite immigrants and their children than in the general U.S. population; this provides building blocks for future research on religion and civic participation among nonwhite and non-Christian populations.  2007 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1086;2007;"We examined in a random-assignment, pretest-posttest design whether college women's body image would improve after reading religious and spiritual affirmations about their bodies. The sample was predominantly white and Christian. In a pretest, women completed measures of religiosity and body esteem (how they felt about their weight and appearance) and were then assigned via matched random assignment to three different groups for a treatment and posttest one week later. In the Religious group, women read affirmations with a theistic and Christian-based tone that emphasized God's love and acceptance of their bodies; in the Spiritual group, women read body affirmations with a more positive secular tone and no mention of God; Control group women read random statements about campus issues. After reading the affirmations, women then viewed photos of ""thin ideal"" fashion models to activate body image concerns. Women next completed the posttest body esteem measures. Women in the Religious group increased significantly compared to Control women (who declined) in how they felt about their appearance and looks. Women in the Spiritual condition improved marginally compared to the Control condition.  2007 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1087;2007;We examined racial/ethnic differences in five measures of religious involvement (worship attendance, religious social support, importance of faith, comfort from religion, and frequency of prayer or meditation) among 2,690 women, age 42-52 years, participating in the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN). The women reported five racial/ ethnic identifications: white, African American, Hispanic, Japanese, and Chinese. A large proportion of the Asian and Hispanic women were born outside the United States (Japanese 48 percent, Chinese 69.5 percent, Hispanic 89.1 percent). African-American and Hispanic women reported the highest levels of religious involvement. White and Japanese women reported similar levels of involvement for four measures. Compared to the white women, the Chinese women reported similar levels of worship attendance and religious social support, but lower levels for the other three measures. These racial/ethnic differences were not explained by differences in religious preference, acculturation, or sociodemographic factors. With the exception of worship attendance, in adjusted models, measures of acculturation were not significantly associated with religious involvement.  2007 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1088;2007;We explore the role of spirituality in the current adjustment of adult survivors of childhood sexual abuse (CSA). A sample of 101 men and women survivors of CSA completed questionnaires on spirituality (relationship with God or higher power), person factors (blame attributions, self-acceptance, hope), and current adjustment (mood, personal growth, resolution of the abuse). Results indicated that relationship with a benevolent God or higher power is related to the experience of less negative mood and a greater sense of personal growth and resolution of the abuse. Also, relationship with a higher power is related to other person factors such as self-acceptance and hope. Relationship with a benevolent God appears to have an indirect link to depressive mood and resolution of abuse through the mediating pathways of hope and self-acceptance. In contrast, relationship with God appears to have a more direct association to the outcome of personal growth for these survivors.  2007 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1089;2007;We hypothesize that the religiously orthodox, who are theologically communitarian/authoritarian in seeing individuals as subsumed by a larger community of believers and as subject to timeless divine law, are more likely to value obedience in children over autonomy than are theological modernists, who are theologically individualistic in seeing individuals, not a deity, as the ultimate arbiters of right and wrong. We hypothesize further that differences in moral cosmology (orthodoxy vs. modernism) within faith traditions are more important for the values adults seek to instile in children than are differences between traditions. Through analyses of national data from the 1998 General Social Survey, we find strong confirmation of both hypotheses. Moral cosmology is the single-most important factor in valuations of obedience and autonomy in children. While evangelical Protestants differ from Catholics, mainline Protestants, and those with no religion in their values for children, moral cosmology is associated with differences in values for children within each of the faith traditions, including evangelical Protestants. We conclude that intra-faith differences in moral cosmology are key in explaining values for children, but have not completely supplanted interfaith differences.  2007 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1090;2007;We present two patterns over time in religious giving, secular giving, and religious service attendance. The first pattern describes the prewar cohort (born 1924-1938) as they aged between middle adulthood (ages 35-49) and their senior years (ages 62-76). The second pattern compares the baby boom cohort (born 1951-1965) in middle adulthood to the middle adulthood of the prewar cohort. We present patterns for all families as well as separately for Catholic and Protestant families using data from three sources. The prewar cohort increased their religious giving and attendance as they aged, but - compared to the prewar cohort in middle adulthood - baby boomers give less than expected to religion and attend less. Baby boomer giving is noticeably less than expected and attendance noticeably lower among Catholic boomers, but less so among Protestant boomers. We argue that together these patterns are evidence that changes in religious giving reflect changes in religious involvement.  2007 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1091;2007;"We use a case study of individuals who leave ultra-Orthodox Judaism to illustrate that essential characteristics of the institutions they leave, such as their degree of encapsulation, shape both processes and narratives of identity change. Through examining the narratives of these exiters and comparing them to the literature on conversion into strict religious groups, we find that there is more institutional support for conversion into a group than for disaffiliating from a group. In conversion, recruits are provided with institutional scripts that shape their narratives; those who leave strict religious communities have no parallel ready-made accounts. Those that leave ultra-Orthodoxy state that they did not have a language to guide them in their transition into secular society. Nevertheless, despite their presentation of themselves as ""scriptless"" they also present themselves as brave individuals who are proud of their ability to leave a community that had encompassed all aspects of life.  2007 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1092;2007;"We use long-term longitudinal data from a sample (N = 155) of older age mainline Protestants, Catholics, and a small number of conservative Protestants to investigate the relations among church-centered religiousness, spiritual seeking, and authoritarianism. In late adulthood, religiousness was related positively, and spiritual seeking was related negatively, to authoritarianism; these relations held even after excluding conservative Protestants and controlling for education, gender, age cohort, and personal flexibility. We find a similar pattern using measures of religiousness, spiritual seeking, and control variables scored in early adulthood, a time interval of close to 40 years.  2007 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1093;2007;Weekend attendance at conventional religious services remains the most common form of social religious action in American society. Debates about secularization, discussions of congregations as sites of political skill-building and mobilization, and research on religion's contributions to stocks of social capital often rely partly on claims about trends in religious service attendance. Yet, existing evidence does not definitively establish whether attendance at religious services declined in American society from the 1950s to the present. We examine the trend in religious service attendance between 1990 and 2006. Evidence from several sources converges on the same answer: weekly attendance at religious services has been stable since 1990. However one reads the evidence about trends between World War II and 1990, the recent past has been a time of stability. This has important implications for theories of religious change.  2007 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1094;2007;"What are the crucial factors that may cause people to become religiously active at a certain point of their lives? I give an overview of key analytic elements of the conventional approaches to conversion: Lofland and Stark's (1965) social networks model; (spoiled) identity and religious seekership; socialization; religious markets; recruitment; cultural factors; and convert role monitoring and mastering. Subsequent sections present a critique of the conventional approaches, with their biases and emphasis on the crisis factor, and a synthesis of their best elements in the conversion career approach (currently in development). The latter distinguishes five levels of religious participation: preaffiliation, affiliation, conversion, confession, and disaffiliation. These levels are, in turn, influenced by personality factors, social factors, institutional factors, cultural factors, and contingency factors. The conversion careers approach offers directions for future research by distinguishing five levels of religious participation, systematically listing the factors in religious participation, avoiding ""crisis determinism,"" developing a conceptualization of the individual with active and passive elements, being gender sensitive, and including a life-cycle approach to avoid the ""adolescent bias"" of earlier literature.  2007 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1095;2008;A growing literature examines how conservative Protestants have made status gains relative to mainline Protestants over the past three decades. The results of these studies are inconclusive: by some measures conservative Protestants have achieved socioeconomic parity, in other accounts significant discrepancies remain. This article examines the relationship between religion of origin and educational attainment, highlighting the significance of both religious background (rather than adult affiliations) and cohort change in understanding religious stratification. The findings are somewhat mixed: while conservative Protestants born since 1960 are no less likely to finish high school than their mainline counterparts, the negative effect of a conservative Protestant background on college completion remains virtually unchanged for cohorts born before 1940, between 1940 and 1959, and between 1960 and 1972, even when controlling for family background. Conservative Protestants are keeping pace with the educational gains made by mainline Protestants in the postwar era, but other factors associated with a conservative Protestant background still exert a negative influence on educational attainment.  2008 Society ]for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1096;2008;"A number of theorists in the sociology of religion hold that denominations in the United States have remained vital by decentralizing power, and shifting control from central hierarchies to individual congregations: a strategy dubbed ""de facto congregationalism.""However, changes in the polity of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (the LDS, or Mormon, Church) contravene this trend. Unlike most denominations, Mormonism-a vital faith by all accounts-has centralized its authority and standardized its programs in recent decades. This article investigates whether the logic of de facto congregationalism applies to Mormonism. From a case study of missionary outreach in an LDS congregation, I investigate how mandates from the church's central headquarters are interpreted and implemented at the grassroots level. My findings show that the church's centralized polity may hinder the functioning of Mormon congregations outside traditional strongholds in Utah and the Intermountain West-a finding consistent with the logic of de facto congregationalism.  2008 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1097;2008;"Although a long tradition of theoretical and sociohistorical analysis has suggested that religious practices and values help African Americans in coping with the distressing sequelae of racism and discrimination, few studies have examined this issue with systematic, quantitative, empirical data. Our work contributes to the literature by: (a) outlining a series of arguments regarding the potential significance of multiple aspects of religious involvement-attendance at services, church-based social support, and religious guidance in daily life-in dealing with harmful psychosocial effects of recent experiences of discrimination; and (b) testing hypotheses derived from two alternative models of the racism-religion-distress relationship using longitudinal data from a nationwide survey. Results indicate that both religious guidance and religious attendance moderate the effects of racism on psychological distress, while congregational support has a direct (but not interactive) effect on distress, thereby partly offsetting (but not buffering) the negative effects of discrimination.  2008 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1098;2008;Although there is a tradition of examining generalized discrimination against multiple targets, recent studies have tended to consider race and homosexuality as separate targets without considering their relationship with each other. Recent studies have also argued for a moral dimension in attitudes to homosexuality, but this has not yet been explicitly modeled as an explanation for patterns of social attitudes. In a questionnaire study of practicing Australian Christians (N = 143), we examined the relationship of religious orientation and ideology (intrinsic, extrinsic, fundamentalism, orthodoxy, and quest) with four attitude targets (Aboriginal Australians, women, homosexual persons, and abortion). Using structural equation modeling (SEM), we develop a two-factor model, incorporating group and moral orientation factors, which completely mediates the relationships between the religiosity variables and the social attitudes. Religiosity variables exhibit different patterns of correlation with the two factors. The two-factor model provides a useful framework for further exploration of socially and politically contested attitudes.  2008 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1099;2008;"Assumptions of racial essentialism lead to inadequate analysis of multiracial churches. Instead, acknowledging ethnic identity as a negotiated phenomenon encourages a richer investigation of how congregational participation stimulates and redefines a person's racial and ethnic identity. The malleability of ethnic identity is such that it is often obscured in favor of other aspects of self. Ethnographic analysis of two multiracial churches, Mosaic and Oasis, indicates that particularistic ethnic affiliations recede when otherworldly, value-rational interests are emphasized. Ethnic transcendence occurs when members adopt a shared identity based on a uniquely congregational understanding of what it means to be a properly religious person (a proper ""Christian,"" ""Jew,"" ""Muslim,"" ""Buddhist,"" etc.). In short, the distinctive accomplishment of multiracial congregations is the cultivation of an inclusive religious identity that overrides divisive aspects of ethnic identity. Moreover, recognizing the varying salience of racial and ethnic identity evokes greater caution regarding what can be assumed when researchers apply the label ""multiracial"" to congregations.  2008 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1100;2008;"Extant measures of spirituality-religiosity, not developed specifically with substance abuse treatment populations in mind, may not be culturally appropriate in regard to either: (1) the 12-step ""culture"" found in many treatment programs; or (2) racial-ethnic minority populations overrepresented in publicly funded programs. A 40-item four-dimensional measure was developed, which differentiates ""religiosity"" (religious practices) from ""spirituality"" (an individual's relationships with God/higher power, others, and self). Instrument development involved: qualitative focus groups with individuals in seven diverse Texas treatment programs; quantitative exploratory and confirmatory (CFA) analyses to test the four-factor model conducted using data from 237 diverse clients in treatment programs in Tennessee and Virginia. Confirmatory analyses indicate acceptable fit indices (>0.90) for the four-factor model, and acceptable reliability estimates for all subdimensions (?0.70) provide further support for the measures. Results support the potential usefulness of the measures.  2008 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1101;2008;Goldfried and Miner (2002) claimed to provide evidence that those high in quest religion are less likely to help a religiously closed-minded person even when the help does not promote closed-mindedness. As a result, they concluded that quest religion is associated with limited, not universal, compassion. An experiment modeled on theirs but avoiding several methodological problems suggested a very different conclusion. Although participants high in quest religion helped a religiously closed-minded person less when doing so promoted closed-mindedness, they were no less likely to help such a person when it did not promote closed-mindedness. These results suggest that quest religion is associated with antipathy toward promoting closed-mindedness, not with antipathy toward religiously closed-minded persons. The scope of compassion associated with quest religion does not appear to be limited in the way Goldfried and Miner claimed.  2008 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1102;2008;I analyze the effects of Catholic schooling, Protestant schooling, and homeschooling on adolescents' religious lives and test three mechanisms through which these schooling strategies might influence religiosity: friendship networks, network closure, and adult mentors. Data from Wave 1 of the National Survey of Youth and Religion suggest that Catholic schoolers attend religious services more frequently and value their faith more highly than public schoolers, but attend religious education classes and youth group less often. Protestant schoolers' involvement in their local congregation is similar to public schoolers', but their faith plays a more salient role in their life and they are more active in private religious activities. Homeschoolers do not differ significantly from public schoolers on any outcome considered. Moreover, friendship networks, network closure, and adult mentors play a very limited role in mediating the relationships between schooling strategies and adolescent religiosity. Interpretations of these findings are presented and discussed.  2008 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1103;2008;I analyze the weekly attendance figures from 71 Protestant churches from across the conservative-to-liberal spectrum in a Midwestern city using multilevel modeling (HLM 6.0). The impact on attendance of factors that are experienced by all churches in the city (bad weather, summer, religious holidays, and secular holidays) and factors unique to individual churches (size, if the church is liturgical or nonliturgical, and denominational affiliation) are assessed to determine if all churches experience similar week-to-week fluctuations or if differences exist based on congregational factors. I interpret the results in light of rational choice theory and the strict church hypothesis in an effort to explain changes in church attendance from one week to the next.  2008 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1104;2008;Immigrant religiosity has recently become a hot topic both in academia and in the public arena. For years, a debate has existed as to whether there is an increase or decrease of immigrant religious participation surrounding the migratory event. Some argue that the act of migration spurs an increase in immigrant religious participation, while others contend that migration is a disruptive event and decreases immigrant religious participation. In addition to contextual factors, a number of micro-level factors may explain this change in religious participation: sex, family composition, religious affiliation, and employment status. This article uses longitudinal data from Quebec, Canada surveying nearly 1,000 immigrants during the 1990s. Results indicate that immigrant religious participation decreases substantially as compared to the average level of religious participation among the same immigrants prior to their migration. Besides religious affiliation, most of the micro-level factors hypothesized to explain this change in religious participation prove statistically insignificant. The lack of significant results for micro-level factors points to environmental factors that may be at work.  2008 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1105;2008;In recent decades we have witnessed increased interest in racially diverse religious organizations. Similar trends are occuring in other institutions, like education and business. In this article I discuss the importance of understanding the role that race, as a system that advantages whites, plays in the congregational life of racially integrated churches. Drawing upon the critical race literature, I propose that because race is central to how our society is organized, interracial chruches will need to placate white members' and affirm their religiocultural preferences and interests in order to sustain a racially diverse congregation. I offer some evidence supporting this claim. I also discuss the strengths and limitations of other perspectives used to explain racially diverse religious organizations.  2008 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1106;2008;"In their 2000 book, Divided by Faith, Michael Emerson and Christian Smith use the case of evangelical Christians to demonstrate how uncompromising individualist ideals get in the way of clear thinking and decisive action about racial inequalities in contemporary American society. We use insights developed from whiteness studies and critical race theory to sharpen and further extend this analysis. More specifically, we suggest: (1) that anti-black stereotypes may be subtler, more pervasive, and more functionally necessary than Emerson and Smith assume; and (2) that the individualistic ideals Emerson and Smith focus on are not race neutral but, instead, are part of a taken-for-granted and vigorously defended majority white culture and identity. These points are developed through a theoretical reconstruction of Emerson and Smith's argument and a reevaluation of their methodological approach and data. Finally, we present data from a recent national survey of race and religion in American life that provide preliminary quantitative support for our revisionist claims.  2008 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1107;2008;Interest in the possible role of religion in shaping attitudes toward the U.S. foreign policy has increased significantly in recent years, but relatively few studies have been conducted. Drawing on a new national survey of church members, we examine the relationships of religious identity, religious involvement, and congregational programs to attitudes about the importance of altruistic foreign policy goals. We find no support for popular claims that evangelical Protestants hold particularly supportive attitudes toward international human rights and humanitarian aid policies. We find only modest support for the idea that attendance at worship services encourages people to be altruistic in a way that influences their views about foreign policy. However, we do find considerable support for the idea that congregations can shape members' views about foreign policy through intentional activities that raise awareness of needs at home and abroad.  2008 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1108;2008;"Is there an ongoing decline in religious beliefs in the Netherlands? Using cross-sectional data from 1979 up to 2005, we focus on traditional Christian faith and belief in the supernatural; the literature suggests that they undergo diverging trends. We first describe these trends using the Social and Cultural Developments in the Netherlands surveys covering the 1979-2005 period. Explanations for the trends are formulated and tested using OLS regression models and a counterfactional simulation technique. Our findings indicate that during the 1979-2005 period both traditional Christian faith and belief in the supernatural declined, although the latter at a slower rate. Since church membership rates are continuously declining as well, belonging and believing still go hand in hand in the Netherlands. The most important explanation for both the decline in traditional Christian faith and the decline in belief in the supernatural is the slow but continuous replacement of older religious affiliated cohorts with younger nonaffiliated cohorts.  2008 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1109;2008;One of the more intriguing paradoxes that has developed in mainline Protestantism over the last 30 years is that mainline clergy have become more politically active. Since the public politicking of mainline clergy in the late 1960s generated storms in the churches, why would clergy become more politically active over time? In this article, we adopt the theoretical structure of a benefit exchange between leaders and members initiated by Mancur Olson. We seek to determine the extent to which church members' appetites for political action by the clergy are shaped by a satiating selective benefit exchange or are driven largely by political compatibility. We propose that because of continued political disagreement between clergy and church members and considerable disapproval of clergy involvement in politics by church members, clergy politicking is allowed largely by the satisfaction of a selective benefit exchange.  2008 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1110;2008;"Patterns and correlates of self-perceptions of spirituality and subjective religiosity are examined using data from the National Survey of American Life, a nationally representative study of African Americans, Caribbean blacks, and non-Hispanic whites. Demographic and denominational correlates of patterns of subjective religiosity and spirituality (i.e., religious only, spiritual only, both religious/ spiritual, and neither religious/spiritual) are examined. In addition, the study of African Americans and Caribbean blacks permits the investigation of possible ethnic variation in the meaning and conceptual significance of these constructs within the U.S. black population. African Americans and Caribbean blacks are more likely than non-Hispanic whites to indicate that they are ""both religious and spiritual"" and less likely to indicate that they are ""spiritual only"" or ""neither spiritual nor religious."" Demographic and denominational differences in the patterns of spirituality and subjective religiosity are also indicated. Study findings are discussed in relation to prior research in this field and conceptual and methodological issues deserving further study are noted.  2008 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1111;2008;"Personality, in terms of both strict personality traits (five factors) and their cultural adaptations (e.g., values), has systematically been found to predict religion. This article focuses on three issues that still remain unclear: predictiveness of personality facets versus the five factors; predictiveness of values versus personality; and similarities and differences between religiosity and spirituality in their associations with personality and values. We administered the NEO-PI-R, the Schwartz Value Survey, and religious measures to Spanish students (N =256). The personality facets provided additional and subtler information than the five factors on individual differences in religion and spirituality. When the overlap between personality and values was controlled for, values were almost unique predictors of these differences. Spirituality shared with religion both a prosocial tendency (with even some intensification) and conscientiousness, but not the emphasis on conservation versus openness to change and to experience.  2008 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1112;2008;Racial integration in religious congregations is a topic of keen interest to researchers and religious leaders. Although not common, there are congregations that successfully reach across cultural lines to attract adherents. Prior studies tend to dichotomize congregations into categories of multiracial and nonmultiracial and, thereby, miss a wider range of racial variation. Using nationally representative congregational data, this article paints a more representative picture of racial diversity in U.S. congregations and puts forward a theory of congregational identity to account for why some congregations succeed at accommodating multiple racial groups in a society where religious life remains overwhelmingly segregated. The analysis capitalizes on a numeric scale of diversity, which measures the evenness of racial group representation in a congregation. While the external environment creates opportunity for racial diversification in congregations, findings demonstrate racially diverse leadership, charismatic worship, and small groups as internal congregational features also relevant to diversity.  2008 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1113;2008;Rather than treating conservative Protestantism as a homogenous phenomenon, recent literature has underlined the importance of disaggregating this group to illuminate important attitudinal and behavioral differences between conservative Protestants. However, the methods used to empirically operationalize conservative Protestantism have not always been able to capture variations within the groupings. Based on analysis of the 2004 Northern Ireland Life and Times Survey, we argue that religious self-identification is a more useful way of analyzing conservative Protestant subgroups than denomination or religious belief. We show that many of these identifications are overlapping, rather than stand-alone, religious group identifications. Moreover, the identification category of born-again has seldom been included in surveys. We find having a born-again identification to be a better predictor than the more frequently asked fundamentalist and evangelical categories of the religious and social beliefs that are seen as indicative of conservative Protestantism.  2008 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1114;2008;"Research and public interest in religion and spirituality is on the rise. Consequently, there is an increasing need for rigorously obtained information on what individuals mean when they use these terms. This study examined how 64 older adults living in three retirement communities (including one Christian-based community), a relatively understudied population, conceptualize religion and spirituality. Participants defined ""religion"" and ""spirituality,"" and their narrative definitions were coded and compared using a framework derived from Hill et al.'s (2000) conceptualization of religion and spirituality. Despite considerable overlap, participants' definitions differed on several dimensions. Participants were more likely to associate religion than spirituality with personal beliefs, community affiliation, and organized practices. Moreover, spirituality appeared to be a more abstract concept than religion, and included nontheistic notions of a higher power.  2008 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1115;2008;"Researchers have shown a longstanding interest in the relationship between religion and mental health. Here, we outline a series of hypotheses linking personal prayer, images of God, and mental health. We then empirically test the hypotheses using data from an online survey of U.S. adults (N = 1,629) conducted in 2004 by Spirituality and Health magazine. We find a positive correlation between both frequency of prayer and the perception of God as remote and several different forms of psychopathology; a perceived intimate relationship with a loving God is inversely related. The positive association between prayer and psychopathology manifests itself primarily among individuals who experience God as either (a) remote or (b) not loving. We also find an inverse correlation between prayer and psychopathology among individuals who believe that they are praying to a close (the inverse of remote) God.

1116;2008;Several decades worth of research have produced mixed results concerning the relationship between beliefs in religious and paranormal phenomena. While this previous work focused on the explicit measurement of these beliefs, these studies focused on a new level of analysis. Specifically, what is the implicit relationship between religious and paranormal constructs? In Study 1, participants completed a version of the Implicit Association Test (IAT) to assess the association between religious and paranormal stimuli, as well as completed measures of religiosity and paranormal belief. Results supported an association between these constructs that was moderated by intrinsic religiosity and faith in science. Study 2 again provided evidence for an association while addressing a methodological concern regarding the IAT. The results are discussed in their impact on the understanding of the cognitive representation of religious and paranormal constructs and the respective belief systems.  2008 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1117;2008;Several investigations of American evangelicalism have been conducted in recent decades, yet they conceptualize evangelicalism in different ways. It is not surprising, therefore, that different profiles of the evangelical movement and its adherents emerge from these studies. This research reviews major studies on the subject undertaken since 1976, when evangelicals first attracted national attention. Using data collected in a single data set - the 1998 General Social Survey - we show how measurement strategies employed in different studies yield drastically different pictures of evangelicalism. Conservative measures indicate that only one in 20 Americans is evangelical while one in two is evangelical according to a combination of more expansive measures. The demographic, cultural, and religious characteristics of evangelicals, as well as theories about them, hinge upon how the population is defined.  2008 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1118;2008;Social scientific research assumes that religious involvement is primarily, if not exclusively, the product of social-environmental influences There is growing evidence, however, that genetic or other biological factors also play a role Analyzing twin sibling data from the National Survey of Midlife Development in the United States (MIDUS), this study addresses this issue by showing that individual-level variation on four different aspects of religious life - organizational involvement, personal religiosity and spirituality, conservative ideologies, and transformations and commitments - is indeed the product of both genetic and environmental influences Specifically, genetic factors explain 19-65 percent of the variation, while environmental influences account for the remaining 35-81 percent depending upon the aspect of religion under investigation Research of this type enhances contemporary social science by providing a new perspective that nicely supplements existing ones, but it also highlights potential implications, including explanatory power deficiencies and potentially bias.  2008 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1119;2008;Substantial previous research indicates that married persons enjoy better mental and physical health than others. One prominent explanation for these patterns is that married persons practice better health behaviors, including lower levels of alcohol consumption, particularly heavy drinking. However, studies of marital status differences in health behaviors have ignored the role of religious homo/heterogamy and attendance, important potential confounding and moderating factors. Focusing on alcohol behavior, we analyze 1977-1994 General Social Survey data, finding that lower levels of drinking are especially pronounced among homogamous conservative couples, and to a lesser extent among mixed-faith unions with one conservative partner. Controlling for other background characteristics, nonconservatives married to nonconservatives do not consistently consume less alcohol than unmarried persons, suggesting that much of the apparent marital status effect on drinking is actually due to religious factors. Contrary to some prior theory and research, these patterns are broadly consistent for both men and women.  2008 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1120;2008;The Council for a Parliament of the World Religions has been meeting since 1993 to foster a global religious ethic toward world peace, based on the premise that major world religions share this ethic in common. Roland Robertson's multidimensional model of globalization is utilized to analyze the Parliament's foundational Declaration, and explore why the Parliament's message is not receiving wider attention. Excerpts from anti-Parliament sources are included. Based on this analysis, the Parliament appears to have a limited conception of globalization, and so offers but a partial knowledge claim on how religion can resolve global problems. Seen in this light, it is not surprising that some oppose the Parliament's agenda, feel alienated by it, or - given its limitations - are not aware of it.  2008 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1121;2008;"The fastest growing form of religious identification, spirituality, or ""new"" religious movement in American society over the last decade is Wicca and related forms of ""Neo-Paganism."" However, with no national organization and minimal local organization, little is known about its distribution across a privatized religious landscape nor about the features of state social and cultural environments that are receptive or contrary to its spread. This study uses Internet data to create estimates of the comparative strength of Wiccan-Pagan identification across the 50 states and conducts multivariate analyses of the ability of variables suggested in prior research to explain its distribution. Not only are the findings consistent with expectations, but differences in correlates of Wicca using the Internet data in contrast to existing measures of ""New Age"" spirituality highlight the empirical importance of maintaining distinctions between the two.  2008 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1122;2008;The international religious data in the World Christian Database (WCD), and its print predecessor, the World Christian Encyclopedia (WCE) have been used frequently in academic studies and the popular press. Scholars have raised questions about the WCD's estimates categories, and potential bias, but the data have not yet been systematically assessed. We test the reliability of the WCD by comparing its religious composition estimates to four other data sources (World Values Survey, Pew Global Assessment Project, CIA World Factbook, and the U.S. Department of State), finding that estimates are highly correlated. In comparing the WCD estimates for Islamic countries and American Christian adherents with local data sources, we identify specific groups for which estimates differ. In addition, we discuss countries where the data sets provide inconsistent religious estimates. Religious composition estimates in the WCD are generally plausible and consistent with other data sets. The WCD also includes comprehensive nonreligious data. Recommendations regarding the use of the WCD are given.  2008 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1123;2008;"The New Age has been reported to be an exemplary religion of modernity, that emphasizes the importance of autonomy and self-development. Attempts to establish whether New Age ideas and practices were oriented toward self-transcendence or if, instead, they reinforced secular individualistic values and behaviors have become a central point of debate among researchers. In order to bring some new light to this debate we compared New Age with Roman Catholic and atheist/agnostic participants on a battery of social-psychological measures, including values, self-concepts, and individualism/collectivism. Results indicate that New Age individuals adopt an individualist outlook similar to that of nonreligious people, but also define themselves using a set of abstract holistic self-concepts, show avoidance of competitive goals, and stress values of universalism. We call this pattern ""holistic individualism"" for its fusion of an individualistic value orientation with highly abstract holistic perceptions of the self.  2008 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1124;2008;"Theorists and clinicians have long believed that religious practice may reduce aggression and other destructive behaviors. To date, most evidence for a relationship between religiosity and aggression comes from nonexperimental studies. The purpose of this exploratory study was twofold. First, to examine experimentally whether two religious practices reduce aggressive behavior; second, to determine if specific aspects of religious orientation and spiritual transcendence are related to level of aggression, expressed under controlled laboratory conditions. Sixty-two participants assigned to one of three experimental groups (memorize Bible passages, prayer/meditation, or control group) completed a laboratory task of aggression. Participants also completed religious and spirituality instruments, along with self-ratings of aggressive disposition. Results indicated that neither memorization of biblical passages nor meditation reduced aggression. Intrinsic-oriented religiosity participants self-reported lower aggression than extrinsic-oriented participants, but no differences were found on the laboratory task of aggression. Spiritual transcendence showed no behavioral aggression differences.  2008 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1125;2008;This article analyzes the determinants of the earnings of American Jewish men using the 2000/2001 National Jewish Population Survey. Nonresponse to the question on earnings is analyzed. Earnings are related to conventional human capital variables, as well as Jewish-specific variables. Except for the size of place and region variables, the standard human capital variables have similar effects for Jewish men and the general male population. Jewish day schooling as a youth enhances earnings. Earnings vary by denomination, with Jewish men who identify their denomination as Conservative earning the most, with secular and Orthodox Jews earning less. The effect on earnings of religiosity (measured by synagogue attendance) is not monotonic. Earnings are highest for those who attend about once a week, are lower for those who attend daily, and are lowest for those who never attend.  2008 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1126;2008;"This article discusses contemporary spiritualities, focusing in particular on the recent growth of practices attending to ""mind, body, and sprit"" and centered on the goal of ""holistic well-being."" We argue that the growing popularity of such ""holistic spirituality"" since the 1980s can be greatly illuminated by reference to Charles Taylor's account of the expressive mode of modern selfhood. Taylor's account is limited, however, by its inability to explain why women are disproportionately active within the sphere of holistic spirituality. By paying closer attention to gender, we seek to refine Taylor's approach and to advance our understanding of contemporary spirituality. Drawing on findings from two qualitative studies of holistic spirituality and health carried out in the United Kingdom, this article offers an analysis of what the ""subjective turn"" may mean for women. We argue that holistic spiritualities align with traditional spheres and representations of femininity, while simultaneously supporting and encouraging a move away from selfless to expressive selfhood. By endorsing and sanctioning ""living life for others"" and ""living life for oneself,"" holistic spiritualities offer a way of negotiating dilemmas of selfhood that face many women - and some men-in late modern contexts.  2008 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1127;2008;This article uses field visits (including photographs) to examine the construction of religious memory in the commemoration of Kristallnacht (Crystal Night) in contemporary German society. Over the last two decades there has been a proliferation of Kristallnacht memorials to the synagogues that were destroyed during the pogroms of November 9, 1938. Based on research at 50 of these memorial sites, I explore the way in which violence against the synagogue (and Jewish sacred objects) has become the symbol of Jewish genocide in German Holocaust remembrance. The findings strongly suggest that the missing synagogue and its destroyed relics have replaced the murdered Jewish citizenry as the predominant subject of memory in public monuments and memorials throughout the country. However, this visual trope as a representation of the sacred is complicated by other attempts at humanizing (and thus implicitly Christianizing) the suffering and sacrifice of the Holocaust.  2008 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1128;2008;"This research project sought to examine the multiple functions that prayer serves in the coping process for members of Christian groups. We used concept mapping to describe and organize a small group of participants' perceptions concerning the functions of prayer when coping with personal difficulties, as well as examined the frequency and perceived effectiveness of these prayer functions. The number and variety of items generated by participants indicates that prayer can be used in multiple ways to deal with personal problems. Inspection of these items and the resulting concept map yielded three bipolar dimensions that describe a variety of prayer functions: approach/ avoidance; internal focus/external focus; and deferring/self-directing. The arrangement of items also corresponded roughly to a three-factor structure found in several existing coping measures. Participants reported that the most effective prayer functions involve seeking guidance and expressing gratitude.  2008 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1129;2008;This study evaluates the psychometric properties and criterion validity of the Religious Social Support (RSS) Scale in a diverse, representative community sample of new mothers (N = 1,156). Results indicated that two factors best represented the RSS. Criterion validity was established by demonstrating that the RSS was associated with relational and health outcomes. However, these associations were reduced to statistical insignificance once a general measure of social support was included as a covariate. There were no indications that race moderated either the psychometric properties of the RSS or the relationships between social support and outcomes. Qualitative analyses indicated that religious social support is a salient construct in the lives of women that we studied and suggested ways to improve future developments of RSS scales.  2008 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1130;2008;"This study extends research on the relationship between religious orientation, sexual prejudice, and antipathy toward value-violating behaviors. If intrinsic religion leads individuals to ""love the sinner but hate the sin,"" homosexual sexually promiscuous targets should be treated similarly to heterosexual promiscuous targets. One hundred female introductory psychology students were provided the opportunity to help two students. They had no information about the first student. The second student disclosed through a note that she was gay or said nothing about sexual orientation, and further stated that she was sexually promiscuous or celibate. Participants scoring high in intrinsic religiousness helped the disclosing student less when she revealed she was sexually promiscuous, but did not help a gay discloser less than a straight discloser. High intrinsic scores seemed to be related to antipathy toward the value-violation, but not toward the gay person as an individual.  2008 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1131;2008;"This study investigated whether audience characteristics identified as important in the conversion and religious recruitment literature could predict reaction to a Christianity-themed recruitment message. More specific goals involved (a) comparing the impact of potential recruits' dispositional attributes and personal motivations versus their situational availability on the persuasive effect of religious recruitment messages; and (b) rank ordering the audience characteristics examined based on their predictive power. Results indicated that dispositional and motivational considerations were more reliable predictors of receivers' responses to the recruitment message than were situational factors. Specifically, five of the six dispositional and motivational variables (i.e., loneliness, perceived childhood attachment history, meaning and purpose, other-orientation, and problem-solving perspective) were-at least under certain conditions-related to participants' interest in the church. The two variables representing situational availability, free time and membership status, however, were either unrelated to interest in the church or related to participants' reactions, but in the opposite direction of what was expected.  2008 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1132;2008;"Thomas F. O'Dea's classic The Mormons identified ""Mormonism's encounter with modern secular thought"" as perhaps the church's greatest problem. In line with secularization theory, O'Dea predicted an attenuation of traditional Mormonism, and an adaptation and gradual liberalization of Mormon theology as the literal interpretation of Mormon origins ""dissolved"" in the solvent of modernity. O'Dea's views on the crisis facing Mormonism were based, in part, on ethnographic field work in Salt Lake City in the summer of 1950, as interpreted by a modernist Catholic sociologist. A review of his field notes suggests that key informants who ""hosted"" much of O'Dea's research activity were liberal Mormon academics who defined the church's traditional theology as a problem. This viewpoint agreed with O'Dea's preconceptions about the ""education and apostasy"" dilemma. A comparison of O'Dea's published ""reading"" of his field notes with the notes themselves suggests the plausibility of alternative readings. One such alternative is offered here, an interpretation of the interplay of education, Mormon theology, and Mormon intellectualism drawn from O'Dea's field notes, but with a different emphasis from that of his essay. Finally, reverting to a modernist perspective, I offer some hints from survey research suggesting that the predicted liberalization of Mormon theology has yet to occur.  2008 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1133;2008;Using data from a representative sample of adults in Toronto, Canada, I examine the education-contingent association between religiosity (subjective religiosity and religious attendance) and four health-related outcomes: depression, anxiety, alcohol use, and self-rated health. I also test the extent that two personal resources-the sense of mastery and self-esteem - contribute to those associations. Findings indicate that subjective religiosity and attendance are generally associated with lower levels of depression, anxiety, alcohol use, and poor health. Moreover, although not entirely uniform, subjective religiosity and attendance tend to be associated more negatively with these outcomes among individuals with fewer years of education. While the sense of mastery suppresses the education-contingent influence of religiosity on distress outcomes, self-esteem generally contributes to those patterns. On balance, the suppression effects of mastery are offset by the explanatory effects of self-esteem. These findings elaborate on the well-established association between religiosity and health by illustrating education-contingent effects and potential counterbalancing roles of personal resources in these processes.  2008 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1134;2008;We establish for the first time a national mortality rate for religious congregations by determining the 2005 status of congregations in the 1998 National Congregations Study sample. The annual mortality rate for religious congregations is 1 percent, which is among the lowest mortality rates ever observed for any type of organization. This unusually low mortality rate probably indicates an organizational population whose weakest members live on in a weakened state rather than an organizational population that is unusually robust all the way down to its most vulnerable members.  2008 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1135;2008;We examine the effects of some oft-overlooked influences on clergy public speech, an important component of a church's public witness. While there are many studies of denominational conflict, few studies connect denominational-level conflict with the ways in which clergy address salient public issues to their congregations. We also explore the impact that the presence of a congregant who has struggled with his or her sexuality, that is, the contact hypothesis, has on clergy speech. We test these ideas using 2004 survey data from clergy in Columbus, Ohio concerning their speech on the state's constitutional ban on gay marriage. We find that these intra-organizational constraints shape opinions that in turn affect speech, tempering indirectly the ability of clergy to present concerns about the proposed ban.  2008 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1136;2008;We explore the possibility that racially inclusive churches are also more inclusive in SES and supportive of gender equality. We used the Lilly Survey of Congregations to compare SES diversity and attitudes toward female leadership between multiracial and nonmultiracial churches. Findings indicate that multiracial churches promote SES diversity, but not necessarily gender equality. The relationship is straightforward as it concerns SES diversity, as multiracial churches are more likely to exhibit SES diversity than nonmultiracial churches. However, we found that a good deal of the propensity of multiracial churches to support gender equality is tied to the size of cities in which they are located. Further, theology acts as a suppressor variable in that conservative multiracial churches are less supportive of gender equality than other conservative churches, while progressive multiracial churches are more supportive of gender equality than other progressive churches.  2008 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1137;2008;"We investigate the relationship between religiosity and support for Islamic rule in the Islamic Republic of Iran (IRI). Are high levels of religiosity associated with an ideology characterized by clerical rule, supremacy of Islamic law, and state enforcement of Islam?The data come from a random sampling survey conducted in Tehran in August 2003. It covers a range of questions on religiosity, social, and political attitudes, and has a sample of 412 respondents. The analyses show that religiosity is closely affiliated with an ideological understanding of Islam in Tehran. Interestingly, political dissatisfaction does not negatively affect this association. Shi'ism in Iran has evolved from a ""world-shaking"" force into a ""world-legitimating"" force.  2008 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1138;2008;We surveyed low-income urban adolescents about their total exposure to urban stressors and their use of religious coping resources, specifically in the areas of social support, spiritual support, and community service opportunities provided by their congregations. Additionally, we assessed their current levels of depressive symptomatology. Among females, the relationship between stress and depressive symptoms was moderated by the use of spiritual support and community service opportunities. The moderating relationship was such that at low levels of stress, high usage of these resources protected against the development of depressive symptoms. At high levels of stress, however, the protective relationship was lost. Lastly, when the social support aspects of religious coping were statistically controlled, the moderation effect disappeared, suggesting that within this sample, the social support seeking aspects of the resources, rather than their religious nature, was responsible for the effects.  2008 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1139;2008;"Women are severely underrepresented in leadership roles and positions in Korean immigrant churches in the United States. Largely based on ethnographic research or casual observations, researchers have pointed to one or another of the following as a central factor in this underrepresentation: (1) the influence of Korean Confucian patriarchal traditions, (2) the conservative theological position of Korean churches, and (3) the practical need of Korean male immigrants to create high-status positions through ethnic churches. Although these three factors are intertwined and even reinforcing in the empirical world, this article intends to illustrate them empirically and pull them into a more analytic scheme. In particular, this article analyzes: (1) denominational affiliations of churches in South Korea and their official positions on female ordination to ministers and elders; (2) denominational affiliations of Korean immigrant churches in New York and their positions on women ordination; and (3) the proportion of women head pastors in churches in Korea and that of women head pastors in Korean immigrant churches in New York.  2008 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1140;2009;A central claim of the religious economies model is that religious competition affects levels of religious participation and commitment primarily because religious competition pushes the suppliers of religion (religious leaders and organizations) to market their faith more vigorously and effectively. We examine whether U.S. congregations experiencing greater religious competition measured by their smaller religious market share do more to recruit new members, offer more services to current followers, and whether their clergy work longer hours. The efforts of congregations and clergy do vary substantially, but this variation is not related to their denomination's market share. The variations are also not due to religious pluralism, intradenominational competition, or evangelical market share. Members of small market share congregations are more committed, but this higher commitment does not appear to arise because religious suppliers are responding to religious competition. Several alternative explanations for the higher commitment levels of small market share groups are offered with a discussion of the implications for theories of religious competition.  2009 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1141;2009;"A growing literature examines the role of religious communities as sources of social support for members, and a smaller body of work also explores negative aspects of social relations within congregations. However, very little is known about the characteristics of religious groups that promote or impede the development of supportive networks. We use data from a unique source - the National Congregations Study, linked with individual records from the 1998 General Social Survey (GSS) - to explore this issue. Key findings reveal that: (1) individuals who attend very large churches tend to report lower levels of anticipated support and informal negative interaction; (2) the presence of major congregational conflict tends to dampen anticipated support and increase informal negative interaction; and (3) the absence of a well-defined period for informal socializing before or after the worship service is associated with lower levels of anticipated support, but is unrelated to the frequency of negative interaction among church members. Several implications and promising directions for future research are discussed.  2009 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1142;2009;An extensive literature has explored the effects of religion on opinions about environmental protection and action on environmental issues, but has largely concerned itself with the effects of theology as inspired by the Lynn White thesis. However, religion is multifaceted and any complete study should also incorporate the social dimensions of religious experience. In this article, we employ a unique data set to demonstrate the varied informational effects of church membership on environmental attitudes. We find that social sources of information in the church shape the dimensions of religious belief and exert much stronger effects on attitudes on the environment than do doctrinal or religiosity measures.  2009 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1143;2009;"Analysis of International Social Survey Program (ISSP) data collected in 18 Western countries in 1998 demonstrates that Christian desires for a public role of religion are strongest in countries where Christian religiosity is numerically most marginal. Moreover, Dutch data covering the period 1970-1996 confirm that the decline of the number of Christians in the Netherlands has been coincided by a strengthening of the call for public religion among the remaining faithful and by increased polarization about this with the nonreligious. Religious decline and religious privatization, two of the most crucial dimensions of secularization (Casanova 1994), hence develop dialectically: as the number of Christians declines, the remaining faithful seem increasingly unwilling to accept the "" secularist truce"" -the secularist contract that guarantees religious freedom yet bans religion from the public sphere by relegating it to the private realm.  2009 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1144;2009;"At the end of the 19th century, British missionaries campaigned to abolish the India-to-China opium trade, whose profits were crucial for British ambitions in Asia. This challenge by the missionaries had been slow to emerge, however, and focusing only on that well-known opposition masks the preceding half-century of accommodations and compromises with the opium traffic, both on the production end (Bengal) and on the receiving end (in Macau and Canton). Our research addresses the subjective calculus that was at work for the missionaries and asks how their reading of that calculus affected their movement across the spectrum from unconcern to outrage about opium. At the core of their enterprise from beginning to end was their unwavering commitment to the evangelical ""Great Commission,"" which spelled out the obligation to bring the Christian gospel to unsaved multitudes around the world. We argue that they consistently embraced whatever was pragmatically necessary to advance that goal and resisted whatever threatened to block movement toward it. Beneath changeability on the surface, a thread of value-rational coherence ran through a century of calculated and strategic missionary activity. The same thread is likely to be in evidence in other theaters of global evangelism where missionaries were (are) involved in secular controversies.  2009 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1145;2009;Borrowing from the literature on religion and deviance, the concept of moral communities is applied to religious and secular postsecondary education to explain institutional influences on student religious participation. Results from nationally representative panel data indicate that students attending Catholic and mainline Protestant affiliated institutions decline in religious participation at a faster rate than students attending evangelical institutions or students attending nonreligious public colleges and universities. This finding is consistent with Catholic and mainline Protestant institutions less successfully providing a shared moral order that legitimates religious language, motive, and behavior when compared to conservative Protestant colleges. At the same time, the religious and ethnic pluralism that activates minority religious identity at nonreligious public institutions is also less likely to be present on Catholic and mainline Protestant college campuses. Additional results indicate that evangelical students' religious participation declines while attending Catholic colleges and universities, while Catholic students increase their participation while attending evangelical institutions. The religious composition of students may act to alter friendship networks, and thus participation rates, on these campuses, although further research is necessary to validate the proposed institutional mechanisms.  2009 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1146;2009;"Despite important connections between religion and military action throughout world history, scholars have seldom explored the association between religiosity and military enlistment. Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), we used a person-oriented analysis to categorize young men according to patterns of adolescent religious involvement. Youth indentified as "" highly religious evangelical"" are more likely to enlist in the military compared to their "" highly religious nonevangelical"" and "" nonreligious"" counterparts; however, these findings hold only for those young men without college experience. These findings are discussed along with study limitations and promising directions for future research.  2009 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1147;2009;Drawing on interviews with 90 young people who have become Witches, we explore the visual media's influence on identity formation and maintenance. Witchcraft is a late modern religion that is highly individualistic and many young people report they have become a Witch without any interaction with other Witches. The rapid growth of interest in this religion among the young since The Craft was first shown provides an important example of the mass media's role in formation of contemporary religious identity. We argue that representations of Witchcraft in the visual mass media (along with other cultural trends such as environmentalism, feminism, and individualism) and cultural resources such as books, Internet sites, and magazines provide a mediated form of social interaction that sustains the plausibility of Witchcraft as a religion. It also helps the young to develop and legitimate their beliefs and practices and develop their Witchcraft persona.  2009 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1148;2009;Drawing upon the cultural repertoire and religious marketplace perspectives, this study examines the extent to which ecstatic, participatory worship practices are distinctive to African-American congregations and explores the role that ecstatic, participatory worship plays in contemporary African-American worship. National Congregations Study (NCS) data are used to conduct comparative analyses of African-American and white congregations' participation in two forms of ecstatic, participatory worship: verbal affirmation and spontaneous physical worship. Findings suggest that while spontaneous physical worship is distinctive to the religiocultural repertoires of African-American congregations, verbal affirmation is not. Traditional explanations about the origin of ecstatic, participatory worship, such as religious tradition, Pentecostalism, and social class, are less compelling than they were in the past. For contemporary African-American congregations, ecstatic, participatory worship is no longer associated with marginal or less-educated congregations, but with more sociopolitically and religiously progressive ones.  2009 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1149;2009;"Fundamentalists typically avoid influences from the outside world and form intense social bonds with members of their own group. Yet, active fundamentalists must create relationships with the objects of their missionary action, the Other. In this article I address the connections between the cultural practice of missionary work and the formation and maintenance of social ties among ultra-Orthodox Jewish missionaries belonging to the fundamentalist Hasidic sect Chabad-Lubavitch. These missionaries attempt to bring Jews to the beliefs and practices of Chabad by hosting Jews at Sabbath meals. This missionary act is an utterance that ""speaks"" with multiple voices, indexing the missionaries as both friendly members of their local Jewish community and ideal Lubavitchers. Through these meals, the missionaries engage not only the local Jews but also other Lubavitchers in dialogue, constructing a community that transcends face-to-face interaction.  2009 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."

1151;2009;If and how Catholic and Protestant schools influence the religious lives of their students once they have graduated is unclear. Methodological limitations and inconsistencies in previous studies have resulted in confusing and often contradictory findings. Using data from two waves of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (N = 11,212), I compare the religious lives of young adults who attended Catholic, Protestant, and secular schools as adolescents. The results suggest that Protestant schoolers are far more religious as young adults than those who attended a secular school, a difference that is at least partially explained by the schools' religious environment. But young adults who attended Catholic schools report levels of religiosity that are similar to those educated in a secular school, and are actually lower for some outcomes. Studies of religious schoolers that ignore the religious tradition of the school overlook these differing effects and forfeit statistical explanatory power.  2009 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1152;2009;"In light of increased scholarly and public discussion about the proper position of religion in higher education, we take stock of existing social scientific studies to illuminate what we know-and what we don't know-about religion and higher education. We argue that research shows that college students are more religiously engaged than has traditionally been thought, but that this interest appears to be more broad than deep; that the college experience does not lead to apostasy in most students, though its effect on students' religious engagements is still unclear; and that religion has a beneficial effect on some student outcomes, but not on others. We conclude by proposing three new directions for research that offer the potential to expand our understanding of the interaction of religion and higher education.  2009 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1153;2009;"In the globalization discourse, Christianity and Islam are often construed as representing two traditions that are conflicted and incompatible. This study engages the ""clash of civilizations"" discourse by examining Muslim-Christian differentials in the use of modern contraception in Nigeria, where Christians have a much higher contraceptive prevalence, and Tanzania, where Muslims are somewhat more likely to use contraception. Employing data from six nationally representative surveys conducted in the two countries between 1990 and 2004 and multilevel logistic regression, we find that the effects of religion remain strong but operate largely through the community religious milieu. Contraceptive use tends to be highest in religiously mixed areas, but the ""optimal"" religious makeup differs between the two nations, reflecting the historically shaped configurations of their religious expressions and politics.  2009 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1154;2009;Korea's religious context is not simple. According to the 2005 Korean Census, the Korean population consists of 23 percent Buddhists, 18 percent Protestants, and 11 percent Catholics, with 47 percent nonreligious. To accurately describe Korean religion in recent periods, we have used 1985, 1995, and 2005 Korean Censuses. We found that Korean people became more religious from 1985 to 1995, but that change was stalled from 1995 to 2005. The percentages of Buddhists and Protestants exhibited little change, and Buddhism continues to be an important religion in the lives of Koreans. Only the number of Catholics increased from 5 percent in 1985 to 11 percent in 2005, and the increasing percentage of Catholics occurred within all subgroups, regardless of age, gender, education, home ownership, and urbanicity.  2009 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1155;2009;"Moral codes are produced and enforced by more or less specialized means and are subject to standard economic forces. This article argues that the intermediary role played by the Catholic Church between God and Christians, a key difference from Protestantism, faces the standard tradeoff of specialization benefits and agency costs. It applies this trade-off hypothesis to confession of sins to priests, an institution that epitomizes such intermediation, showing that this hypothesis fits cognitive, historical, and econometric evidence better than a simpler rent-seeking story. In particular, Catholics who confess more often are observed to comply more with the moral code; however, no relationship is observed between mass attendance and moral compliance.  2009 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1156;2009;"People who are neither very religious nor specifically nonreligious are generally understudied despite comprising on average half the national population in most European countries. From its size alone, we should expect this group to hold some of the clues, not only to how religious change takes place in Europe, but also why. Using the Religious and Moral Pluralism (RAMP) survey from 10 European countries, four subtypes of "" fuzzy fidelity"" were identified through cluster analysis. These included both "" believing without belonging"" and "" belonging without believing."" Detailed analysis of each type show great national differences in the ways that religion is practiced and understood. A sizable minority of the Dutch population can be classified as "" Believing without belonging,"" whereas Scandinavians are much more likely to belong without believing. The diversity of the religious landscape within fuzzy fidelity highlights the methodological issues involved in using single-scale measures for multidimensional phenomena.  2009 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1157;2009;Prior research argues that religious homophily in social networks is a product of overlapping interests and activities unintentionally leading to relationships or the intentional seeking of relationships with people of similar religious beliefs. This article advances research on religious homophily by including the role that exclusive theological beliefs play in explaining religious homophily among friends. We lay out three propositions for individual-, congregational-, and cross-level effects on the relationship between exclusive theology and embeddedness within one's congregation. Using multilevel models and data from the U.S. Congregational Life Survey (USCLS), we find support for our three propositions. We discuss our findings in terms of how exclusive theologies may contribute to bonding forms of social capital, but limit exposure to diverse social perspectives and bridging forms of social capital.  2009 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1158;2009;"Prior research on those who are "" not religious"" in the traditional, organizational sense has focused on a broad category of people in the United States who do not identify with an established religious tradition. We distinguish three categories of people who are religiously nonbelieving or nonbelonging: atheists, agnostics, and unchurched believers. Examining issues of religious belief and identity, we compare private spiritual life, attitudes on political issues, and stance toward religion in the public sphere for these three categories of nonreligious respondents. Atheists are the most uniformly antireligious. Agnostics, by comparison, are less opposed to religion overall, while unchurched believers display higher levels of personal religiosity and spirituality than atheists or agnostics. While atheists, agnostics, and unchurched believers are similar in their political identification and attitudes related to religiously infused political topics, unchurched believers are as strongly opposed to religion in the public sphere as atheists.  2009 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1159;2009;Rational choice theorists of religion have assumed that Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations advocates a free market in religion, which, they argue, leads to increased religious vitality. In fact, while Smith opposed direct government subsidies for religion and argued that a free market was the first-best solution, as a second-best policy he advocated religious regulation, including state-appointed clergy and the reduction of clergy income. Smith's rational choice approach to religion, which springs from his understanding of public goods, externalities and the need for civil peace, and government stability, can still provide direction for social scientific research, but it does not always support a policy of religious free markets.  2009 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1160;2009;"Recent attention from media, scholars, and religious leadership has focused on the dating activities of college students, particularly in relation to casual physical encounters or what some have termed ""hooking up."" In this article, we examine the impact of both individual and institutional religious involvement on ""hooking up"" in a national sample of college women (N = 1,000). The results of our analysis reveal several important patterns. First, Catholic college women are more likely to have ""hooked up"" while at school than college women with no religious affiliation. Second, conservative Protestant college women are less likely to have ""hooked up"" while at school than college women with no religious affiliation; however, this difference is mediated or explained by church attendance, which is protective against ""hooking up."" Finally, women who attend colleges and universities with a Catholic affiliation are more likely to have hooked up while at school than women who attend academic institutions with no religious affiliation, net of individual-level religious involvement.  2009 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1161;2009;Recent years have witnessed the resurgence of conservative Protestantism and its adherents' advocacy of gender traditionalism. Scholarship has traced conservative Protestant women's support for gender traditionalism to biblical inerrancy while linking conservative Protestant men's support for gender traditionalism to their denominational affiliation. Our study revisits this issue with more recent data, more sophisticated analytical techniques (structural equation modeling), and a refined measure of theological conservatism (accounting for beliefs pertaining to scripture, sin, and salvation). We find that theological conservatism is significantly related to gender traditionalism among conservative Protestant women but not men. For men, strength of denominational affiliation is more strongly related to traditionalist ideology. Strength of affiliation also affects gender ideology for women, but its effects, as well as those of religious attendance, are largely indirect through theological conservatism. We discuss these sex-specific patterns of religious influence in the context of conservative Protestantism exhibiting characteristics of a gendered institution.  2009 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1162;2009;Reliable individual differences have not yet been identified in moral hypocrisy. This research examined whether intrinsic religious motivation combined with an experimental religious priming manipulation would predict decreased moral hypocrisy. A sample of Christian college students (N = 142) completed the Religious Orientation Scale-Revised, and the moral motivation paradigm, which tests whether participants will act in accordance with their moral beliefs at a cost to themselves. Half the participants received religious priming prior to the procedure. Intrinsic religiosity predicted decreased moral hypocrisy, but only when religiosity was primed. Findings support Allport's view of intrinsic religiosity, but with an emphasis on cognitive processes in addition to motivational ones.  2009 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1163;2009;Religious doubt arises from a process in which there is a precipitant, the experience of doubt, a coping response, and a health-related outcome. We assess whether social factors precipitate doubt and the coping responses that are invoked to deal with doubt. We evaluate whether these coping responses are, in turn, associated with health. Over time, people who encounter more negative interaction with fellow congregants have more doubts about religion, whereas more spiritual support and greater involvement in prayer groups are associated with less religious doubt. People who encounter more negative interaction are more likely to suppress religious doubts, but people who attend Bible study groups are more likely to seek spiritual growth when faced with doubt. Suppressing religious doubt is associated with less favorable health, whereas seeking spiritual growth has no significant effect.  2009 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1164;2009;The fact that women are more religious than men is one of the most consistent findings in the sociology of religion. Miller and Stark (2002) propose that a gender difference in risk preference of physiological origin might explain this phenomenon. While acknowledging the utility of their risk-preference mechanism, we believe that their assumption regarding the genesis of this difference is a premature concession to biology. Returning to Miller's original paper on gender, risk, and religiosity, we draw on power-control theory (PCT), developed in the work of John Hagan and colleagues, to introduce a plausible socialization account for these differences. We evaluate these claims using data from the General Social Survey. Women raised by high-socioeconomic status (SES) mothers are less religious than women raised by low-education mothers, but mother's SES has little effect on men's chances of being irreligious and father's SES has a negligible effect on the gender difference in religiosity.  2009 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1165;2009;The relationship between the material culture of public worship and congregants' homes is explored in a study of two Catholic parishes - theologically liberal St. Brigitta and conservative Our Lady of Assumption. At St. Brigitta, congregants' worship space is almost devoid of religious art and ritual objects are plain, but worshippers' homes are rich in decorative objects. By contrast, masses at Our Lady of the Assumption take place in a church filled with devotional art and ornate objects, but worshippers' homes are spare, neutrally furnished, and display few decorations. Distinct congregational logics surrounding the making of the self help to explain the material culture differences: St. Brigitta parishioners value individualized self-expression whereas Assumption's members subordinate individuality to family and church identities. Individuals use material objects not only for self-expression, but also to explicitly shape identities and make the self.  2009 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1166;2009;The underlying assumption of this article is that prophetic statements composed for publication in religious organizations as the word of God are, in some form and to some degree, socially constructed. We expand on this assumption by comparing and contrasting The Family International and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints-both of which are organized around belief in ongoing prophecy and revelation. Derived from our comparative analysis of these two religious groups, we formulate a prophecy typology that specifies (1) the channels through which revelations are proclaimed (a designated individual or group of collaborators) and (2) the modality of prophetic statements attributed to a divine source (inspirational or oracular). Based on this typology we conclude by proposing a set of hypotheses for guiding further studies in the social construction of prophecy.  2009 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1167;2009;This article focuses on the perceptions of baalei teshuvah, Jews who were raised with little identification with Judaism as a religious system and subsequently became Orthodox, as an example of the social integration of a group that migrates from one community to another. The baalei teshuvah participants perceived themselves as unique and distinct from those who were raised Orthodox and preferred to associate with others like themselves. They experienced a mixture of pride in their own religious fervor and embarrassment over their lack of knowledge compared with those who grew up Orthodox. At the same time they expressed ambivalent feelings toward Jews who were raised Orthodox. Immigration theory and the concepts of human, social, religious, and spiritual capital are used to discuss the baalei teshuvah's marginal status and preference to associate with other baalei teshuvah.  2009 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1168;2009;This article investigates whether the prevalence of conservative churches, which has been associated with variation in demographic patterns in Western Europe (Lesthaeghe and Neels 2002), can explain geographic differences in family demographic patterns-specifically fertility-in the U.S. nonblack population. Lesthaeghe and Neels find that a second demographic transition (SDT)-characterized by increasing prevalence of nontraditional family and household structure-is hindered by the presence of strong conservative religious institutions. The high religiosity of the United States compared with Western Europe makes it an interesting test case for the theory. This article analyzes the relationship between nonblack fertility and rates of membership in conservative Protestant and Latter Day Saint churches (conservative churches) among nonblacks in U.S. counties and shows that conservative church membership indeed is an independent factor in geographic differences in family demographic patterns-especially with regard to the timing of parenting, but less so with regard to nonmarital childbearing.  2009 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1169;2009;This study builds upon past studies of denominational culture and racial attitudes by positioning evangelicals as the basis of comparison when assessing denominational differences in American racial attitudes. The study also attempts to extend the theoretical contribution of religious culture and racial attitudes by assessing support for race-based policies among black, white, Hispanic, and Asian-American evangelical and nonevangelical Protestants. In short, arguments about a distinctive individualistic religious culture among evangelicals may be useful in explaining why white evangelicals maintain lower levels of support for policies aimed at reducing racial inequality than do mainline and secular whites. However, it is of less relevance in explaining the race-based policy attitudes of white evangelicals relative to white Catholics and among nonwhites as a whole.  2009 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1170;2009;This study examines the association between religiosity and personal mastery in the Chinese context, testing two theses: relinquished control and personal empowerment. Using data from a nationally representative sample of 1,881 Taiwanese adults, I find that: (a) beliefs in karma and one supreme God and prayer are negatively associated with the sense of mastery and (b) the estimated net effect of some devotional activities, such as meditation, appear to be robust, statistically significant, and positive. Implications of this study are discussed.  2009 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1171;2009;"This study explores immigration reform as a possible new ""moral"" issue upon which American religious elites and organizations take public positions. It is argued that religion is a key independent variable necessary for understanding the determinants of public attitudes regarding immigration policy. Theoretical expectations are formed from the ethnoreligious, religious restructuralism, and minority marginalization frameworks. Quantitative evidence is presented, that demonstrates that those who attend religious services more frequently are more likely to support liberal immigration reform policies. Members of minority religions, notably Jews and Latter-day Saints, are also more likely to empathize with the plight of undocumented immigrants and support liberal immigration reform measures.  2009 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1172;2009;This study has two goals. The first goal is to see if church-based social relationships are associated with change in self-esteem. Emotional support from fellow church members and having a close personal relationship with God serve as measures of church-based social ties. The second goal is to see whether emotional support from fellow church members is more strongly associated with self-esteem than emotional support from secular social network members. The data come from an ongoing nationwide survey of older adults. The findings reveal that having a close personal relationship with God is associated with a stronger sense of self-esteem at the baseline and follow-up interviews. In contrast, emotional support from fellow church members was not associated with self-esteem at either point in time. However, emotional support from secular social network members is related to self-esteem at the baseline but not the follow-up interview.  2009 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1173;2009;Though many congregations structure youth ministry programs to foster desired religious and social outcomes, questions remain regarding whether participation in religious-based youth programs is beneficial for the youth involved. Studies show that religion typically results in positive life outcomes for youth, but less is known about the causal mechanisms through which religion makes a difference in their lives. Data analyzed are from two waves of the National Study of Youth and Religion (NSYR). This article examines the effect of youth participation on adult support, church connections, and moral values. A multivariate analysis with lagged dependent variables indicates some effects of youth group participation as well as self-selection processes.  2009 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1174;2009;Two studies examined religious and political predictors of Hindus' attitudes toward Hindus and Muslims. In the first study, data came from interviews with 311 leaders of religious groups encamped at the Magh Mela, an annual religious gathering held at the confluence of the Ganges and Yamuna Rivers in northern India. Results indicated that most of the indicators of religious involvement were positively related to favoritism of the ingroup (Hindus) rather than devaluation of the outgroup (Muslims). In contrast, affiliation with the Hindu-nationalist political party (Bharatiya Janata Party) was related to devaluation of Muslims rather than favoritism of Hindus. In the second study, which involved interviews with 107 kalpavasis (pilgrims) who visited a subsequent Mela, results indicated, consistent with the first study, that religious beliefs were positively related to favoritism of Hindus. A religious behavior, frequency of worship, was related to negative evaluations of Muslims. Overall, religious leaders and kalpavasis did not differ in their ratings of Muslims, but, congruent with the notion that the more strongly one identifies with the ingroup, the more impact it will have, religious leaders evaluated Hindus significantly more positively than did kalpavasis.  2009 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1175;2009;"Using a life course approach, this study examines trajectories of religious participation from early adolescence through young adulthood. Distinct patterns of religious participation are identified, providing insight into how trajectories are shaped by family and religious characteristics and demonstrating the influence of life events on changes in religious participation. The study employs a group-based method of trajectory analysis, identifying three trajectories of stable religious participation (nonattendance, occasional attendance, and frequent attendance) and three trajectories of change (early, late, and gradual declining attendance). Residing with two biological parents and in a religious family increases the likelihood that youth attend religious services throughout adolescence. Religious disaffiliation is associated with lower religious participation for youth in all trajectories; marriage, cohabitation, and religious switching/conversion are associated with changes in participation among youth in the frequent and occasional attendance trajectories only.  2009 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1176;2009;Using new survey data (N = 1,646), we examine the attitudes academic scientists at 21 elite U.S. research universities have about the perceived conflict between religion and science. In contrast to public opinion and scholarly discourse, most scientists do not perceive a conflict between science and religion. Different from what other studies would indicate, this belief does not vary between social and natural scientists. We argue that maintaining plausibility frameworks for religion is an important correlate of whether scientists will reject the conflict paradigm, with such frameworks taking surprising forms. When scientists do not attend religious services they are more likely to accept the conflict paradigm. When scientists think their peers have a positive view of religion, they are less likely to agree there is a conflict between science and religion. Religious upbringing is associated with scientists adopting the conflict paradigm. Spirituality is much more important in this population than other research would lead us to believe. Results reformulate widely cited earlier research, offer new insights about how scientists view the connection between religion and science, and expand public discussion about religious challenges to science.  2009 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1177;2009;Using quasi-experimental data, this article examines the relationship between religiosity and prosocial behavior. In contrast to previous studies that identify religious people by how often they attend religious services or by their self-reported religiosity, this study compares the behavior of highly devout students who are preparing to enter the clergy to the behavior of other students in a public goods game and in the dictator game. The results show that religious students were significantly more cooperative in the public goods game and significantly more generous in the dictator game than other students.  2009 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1178;2009;Utilizing a cultural-developmental approach, this interview study examined how children, adolescents, and adults from religiously liberal and conservative groups conceptualize God and the Devil. Participants (N = 120) conceptualized God and the Devil along similar dimensions, including number (e.g., one, many), gender, central attributes (e.g., physical, supernatural), and evaluation (e.g., positive, neutral). Within-subject differentiations of God and the Devil occurred on all dimensions. Religiously liberal and conservative groups differed on attributes, evaluations, and degree of control ascribed to God and the Devil. With respect to age, results suggest a rethinking of the Piagetian interpretation that children's conceptions of supernatural entities are more concrete, more anthropomorphic, and less abstract than those of adolescents and adults. The results instead point to the usefulness of a cultural-developmental approach.  2009 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1179;2009;"We explore two competing approaches to internal religious divisions and their political consequences. The "" moral cosmology"" approach focuses on religious worldviews. It juxtaposes the religiously orthodox to modernists, arguing that the former are theologically communitarian in belief while the latter are individualistic. The religiously orthodox worldview (relative to modernists) is posited to lead to politically conservative stances on cultural issues of abortion, sexuality, and family but politically liberal stances on economic issues. In contrast, the "" subcultural identity"" approach focuses on identity rather than worldview. According to this approach, self-identified evangelicals and fundamentalists are expected to be more politically conservative on both cultural and economic issues when compared to mainline or liberal Protestants. Through analyses of the 1998 GSS, which allows operationalization of the two approaches and their extension to Catholic identities, we find that cosmology and identity are associated, but they have independent-and sometimes opposite-effects on Americans' political beliefs.  2009 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1180;2009;We investigate whether there is a relationship between religious affiliation and child mortality among indigenous and nonindigenous groups in Chiapas, Mxico. Our analysis relies on Brass-type estimates of child mortality by ethnicity and religious affiliation and multivariate analyses that adjust for various socioeconomic and demographic factors. The data are from the 2000 Mexican Census 10 percent sample. Among indigenous people, Presbyterians have lower rates of child mortality than Catholics. However, no significant differentials are found in child mortality by religious affiliation among nonindigenous people. The indigenous health ministry of the Presbyterian Church and the social and cultural transformations that tend to accompany religious conversion may have an impact on child survival among disadvantaged populations such as the indigenous people in Chiapas.  2009 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1181;2009;We propose that the internalization of orthodox Christian beliefs serves as a basis for a personal moral standard that discourages prejudice against others as well as for self-critical emotions that follow upon behaving in a discriminatory manner. Two correlational studies tested hypotheses derived from our theory. Study 1 demonstrated that to the extent people endorse orthodox Christian beliefs, they report an internal motivation to respond without prejudice toward homosexuals. Study 2 demonstrated that, when controlling for the effects of right-wing authoritarianism (RWA), endorsement of orthodox Christian beliefs was related to positive attitudes toward homosexuals as individuals or as a group, but not toward homosexuality as a behavior or lifestyle.  2009 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1182;2009;"We use the 2008 General Social Survey to estimate the prevalence of clergy sexual advances toward adults in their congregations. Overall, 3.1 percent of women who attend religious services at least monthly reported being the object of a sexual advance by a clergyperson or religious leader in their own congregation since turning 18; 2.2 percent of regularly attending women reported a sexual advance from a married leader that did not lead to an openly acknowledged relationship. We examine differences in the prevalence of this experience by education, region, religious tradition, marital status, age, and race.  2009 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1183;2010;A growing number of studies have systematically examined the relationships between religiousness and value priorities. However, few studies have utilized multidimensional constructs of religiousness or attempted to distinguish among the value priorities of the religious. Using a general public sample and a churchgoer sample in the United Kingdom, this article examines the associations between Schwartz's values, several general religion measures, and conceptualization of God. Religiousness aligns most strongly along the conservation/openness to change value dimension, and spirituality is rotated further toward self-transcendence values. Findings suggest a shift among the religious away from an emphasis on security. God concepts are uniquely related to some value types. Particularly among the churchgoers, for whom God concepts may be especially formative, characteristics attributed to God are reflected in value priorities. These findings support the theoretical assertion that conceptualization of God is a foundational religious belief implicated in more specific values, attitudes, and beliefs.  2010 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1184;2010;"According to available research, congregations with strict rules and dense social networks are better able to screen out free-riders (""selection"") and encourage greater levels of commitment among members (""production""). Both selection and production raise levels of individual giving. Research testing these processes generally utilizes a measure of network density. This study examines whether organizations that are a ""federation of small groups"" are better able to monitor members and hold them accountable, thus assuring acceptable levels of commitment on the part of members. Results of multilevel modeling using data from the 2001 U.S. Congregational Life Survey indicate that cell-based congregations elicit higher levels of financial giving among congregants, net of all other effects, including network density. Moreover, cross-level interactions between the cell-based congregation variable and theological exclusivity as well as attendance are significant and positive. Cell-based congregations provide a context in which individual-level predictors of giving become more robust.  2010 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1185;2010;"Adapted from a Shin Buddhist style of meditation, Naikan ("" inner-looking"" ) is a week-long contemplative practice that involves reviewing one's life from the perspectives of others and has been called an indigenous Japanese psychotherapy due to its effectiveness in treating a variety of disorders. Data collected during an extended ethnographic study of Naikan in both Japan and Austria reveal that Naikan, a "" secularized"" practice that removes overtly Buddhist references and practices, effects changes in clients' subjectivity that are strikingly similar to those sought after in Buddhist traditions. This suggests that Naikan operates therapeutically on an existential level and employs cognitive techniques that, while originating in Buddhism, remain efficacious outside a Buddhist context. The potential for certain contemplative practices to effect transformations of subjectivity across religious and cultural contexts may be greater than commonly assumed.  2010 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1186;2010;An implicit measure of religiousness-spirituality (RS) was constructed and used in two studies. In Study 1, undergraduates completed a Religiousness-Spirituality Implicit Association Test (RS-IAT) and several self-report measures of RS and related constructs (e.g., religious fundamentalism, authoritarianism). Informants rated the participants' RS. The RS-IAT was internally consistent. Implicit RS correlated positively with self-reported RS, spiritual transcendence, spiritual experiences, religious fundamentalism, and intrinsic religiousness. Informant ratings correlated positively with participants' self-reported religiousness but not implicit RS. In Study 2, implicit RS accounted for unique variability in self-reported attitudes toward gay men and lesbian women when controlling for self-reported religiousness and right-wing authoritarianism. These findings demonstrate that an implicit measure of trait RS explains some variability in attitudes that self-report measures do not. An implicit measure of RS could advance the scientific study of religion beyond what is known from self-report measures.  2010 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1187;2010;Building off of Dean Kelley's and Laurence Iannaccone's earlier work, we develop a path model of the strictness thesis that investigates and compares how congregational strictness, evangelical theology, demographic characteristics, and denominational identity variously contribute to congregational growth and decline. Using the U.S. Congregational Life Survey (2001), we test this model at the congregational level and find significant support for the mechanisms at the core of both Kelley's and Iannaccone's versions of the strictness thesis, particularly that even after controlling for the other dynamics mentioned, congregational strictness has both an indirect and a direct positive effect on congregational growth. We also find, however, that evangelical theology, fertility, and denominational identity all play important roles in the prediction of growth, leading us to assert our integrated model as a new and more fully robust understanding of congregational growth and decline.  2010 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1188;2010;Chronic pain (CP) is a stressful condition that severely impacts individuals' lives. Researchers have begun to explore the role of religion for CP patients, but the literature is scarce, especially for West European populations. Drawing from the transactional theory of stress, this study examined the associations between the religious meaning system and the life satisfaction for a group of CP patients who were members of a Flemish patients' association. To take into account the religious landscape of West European countries, the centrality of one's religious meaning system, rather than religious content, was the focus. Results from the questionnaires completed by 207 patients suggest that the centrality of a meaning system is an important factor in the promotion of life satisfaction for this group, above and beyond the influence of several control variables. Furthermore, the centrality of the religious meaning system moderated or buffered the detrimental influence of pain severity on life satisfaction.  2010 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1189;2010;Despite the importance of young people in determining future trends in women's advancement in the predominantly Muslim countries of the Middle East, no quantitative study to date has focused exclusively on the relationship between Islamic religiosity and gender egalitarianism among youth in the region. Using data from the Youth, Emotional Energy, and Political Violence Survey, I investigate the relationship between Islamic religiosity and gender egalitarianism among youth in Saudi Arabia and Egypt, devoting special attention to gender differences within countries. Particular dimensions of Islamic religiosity have different effects on gender egalitarianism by group, reflecting social currents in each country's civic sphere. For young men in both contexts, orthodoxy and mosque attendance are negatively associated with gender egalitarianism. In contrast, for Egyptian young women self-identified religiosity positively affects gender egalitarianism while for Saudi Arabian women, Islamic religiosity has no effect.  2010 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1190;2010;During an initial period of rapid expansion, American Spiritualists did not form churches or settle ministers. As a result, something other than numbers and locations of churches and ministers must chart the 19th-century rise of this religious movement. Fortunately, the leading Spiritualist newspaper of the period, the Banner of Light, published extensive lists of public meetings, lectures, and prospective lecturers. In addition, both the Banner and the Spiritual Telegraph newspapers published early lists of their subscription agents. Even though they do not directly address the central Spiritualist activity of the sance, these lists offer a detailed view of where and when the initial and rapid growth of American Spiritualist activity occurred. Data gathered from these lists put explanations about the rise of this 19th-century Spiritualist movement on a better empirical foundation.  2010 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1191;2010;Few studies have focused on how religious congregations are associated with crime rates, especially at the neighborhood level. Using data for more than 400 block groups in Indianapolis, we focus on the relationship between different types of congregations (e.g., evangelical Protestant, civically engaged) and eight different types of crime controlling for a variety of neighborhood characteristics. The results suggest that neighborhoods with more evangelical Protestant congregations have higher rates of both violent and property crimes. Neighborhoods with more mainline and black Protestant congregations have higher rates of property crimes, but not violent crimes. Finally, although civically engaged congregations are associated with lower neighborhood crime rates, the association may be limited to some types of property crimes. Therefore, the positive association between evangelical Protestant congregations and crime may be more general, and the negative association between civically engaged congregations and crime more limited, than previous research has suggested.  2010 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1192;2010;Five competing explanations for why white evangelicals hold right-of-center political attitudes are examined using data from the 2000-2004 National Election Studies. Dependent variables include attitudes about abortion, homosexuality, immigration, national defense, and social spending. The five competing explanations accounting for conservative positions are: religiosity, moral standards traditionalism, gender and family ideology, class culture, and cultural geography. Moral standards traditionalism attenuated the evangelical effect on attitudes about abortion, homosexuality, and social spending. Religiosity and male-dominant gender ideology attenuated the effect on abortion and homosexuality only. In a second set of models, which include members of all major religious groups, these three variables, together with low levels of education, were significantly associated with conservative attitudes. Moral standards traditionalism demonstrated the most consistent, and generally the strongest, effects across dependent variables.  2010 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1193;2010;Generally regarded as a rural phenomenon, the spread of religious revivalism in the Second Great Awakening may have also been associated with urbanization and early industrialism. This report of a secondary analysis of data originally collected by John Hammond (The Politics of Benevolence[1979]) provides support for the urban argument. Ordinary least-squares and Poisson regression analyses of the incidence of revivalism indicate that revivalism is associated with population size, township manufacturing, location in agricultural counties, and proximity to other towns experiencing revivals. Among urban places and manufacturing towns, the highest levels of revivalism are found in New York's western region. However, the results also uncover a strand of revivalism in the rural northern part of the state that cannot be reduced to the principal variables. The significance of these findings for the study of the Second Great Awakening and American evangelicalism broadly is highlighted.  2010 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1194;2010;Hood developed a Mysticism Scale based on the theoretical work of Stace. The scale was tested by Hood and others in a comparative perspective. Using an abridged version of Hood's Mysticism Scale, we join the debate with a study of a much larger number of Christian, Muslim, and Hindu respondents (1,920 college students) living in Tamil Nadu, India. Our empirical analysis yields a moderately reliable model of mystical experience that permits comparison between the three religious traditions. We argue for the usefulness of a comparative model of vertical mysticism that combines with the complementary common characteristics of noetic quality and ineffability. Vertical mysticism has a revelatory, ineffable character and is comparable in the experience of adherents of the Christian, Islamic, and Hindu traditions.  2010 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1195;2010;How might the social scientific study of religion (SSSR) benefit from adjusting some of its journal article publishing standards and practices? This article builds on five presuppositions about the purpose and nature of good sociology in order to advance five specific proposals for changes in how we write, review, and make use of journal articles in the field. Those proposals concern the publishing of descriptive empirical research notes, meta-analysis review essays, detailed methodological information, arguments about causation, and analytical emphases on the substantive power of variables rather than mere statistical significance. The purpose and expected result of these proposed publishing adjustments is to increase the quality, value, and cumulative nature of the scholarship produced in the SSSR.  2010 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1196;2010;I use cognitive dissonance theory as a framework to examine coping strategies used by men endeavoring to maintain a coherent sense of themselves as gay Christians. Using interviews with black gay Christian men, I uncover a strategy used to maintain that identity in the face of stigmatizing religious rhetoric. While these men have managed to reconcile their religious and sexual identities, sermons delivered by church leaders disrupt that reconciliation, causing them to have to neutralize these anxiety-inducing attitudes. This study shows that they focus accusations of illegitimacy on the speaker rather than the doctrine by denigrating the speakers' knowledge, morality, focus, and motivations. In this way, they neutralize the sting of churches' negative messages by neutralizing the moral authority of the churches' messengers. These findings offer new insight into how parishioners persist in religious communities in which their sexual behaviors or identities are condemned.  2010 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1197;2010;In the fall of 2004, the National Association of Evangelicals produced a statement advocating more resources to combat environmental degradation and promote environmental sustainability. We assess several possible mechanisms for this opinion change using data from a survey experiment. In particular, we test for the effects of group cues, identity, and a new cue-the decision-making process-in which communicating the way a source went about making a decision can affect how other cues are utilized. In contrast to decades of research, we find that a group cue has little effect, while the process cue alters how in- and out-group members think about environmental protection and the players involved in this political drama.  2010 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1198;2010;Korea may provide an important testing ground for assessing religious growth as a correlate of religious authority. In Korea from 1985 to 1995, all religious groups experienced growth, but from 1995 to 2005 only the Catholic population did so. Favorable images of Korean Catholicism compared to other Korean religions point to one factor that may account for this trend, namely, confidence in religious leaders. Up to now there has been no empirical test measuring confidence in religious leaders among different religious groups in Korea. Using the 2003-2007 Korean General Social Surveys cumulative data, we found a hierarchy of confidence in religious leaders ranging from highest to lowest as follows: Catholics, Protestants, Buddhists, no religion. Our finding may suggest the continued vitality of Catholicism in Korea.  2010 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1199;2010;"Media outlets and observers of American religion suggest that young evangelicals are retreating from the ranks of the ""Christian right"" and are embracing more liberal positions on controversial social issues. We test this hypothesis using the Baylor Religion Survey. We examine two separate measures of evangelical identity as well as a wide variety of political identifications and attitudes. Our study indicates that young evangelicals (1) are significantly more likely than older evangelicals to think that more should be done to protect the environment; (2) hold views similar to older evangelicals regarding abortion, same-sex marriage, stem cell research, marijuana use, government welfare spending, spending on the nation's health, and the war in Iraq; and (3) remain significantly more conservative than nonevangelicals on these same social issues. We find no strong evidence to support the notion that young evangelicals are retreating from traditional positions or increasingly adopting more liberal positions on hot-button or controversial social issues.  2010 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1200;2010;Over the last century, a new form of strategic philanthropy arose-that of the private foundation. Foundations do not account for a large portion of donations received by religious organizations, but they can deploy important resources at critical moments. Examining data between 1999 and 2003 from the Foundation Center on grants and grant making, we find that a very small number of foundations are dominant actors in religious strategic philanthropy. These organizations introduce isomorphic tendencies within American religion. Federal tax policies and financial scandals precipitated the emergence of more organizational forms-regranting organizations, supporting organizations, and oversight organizations. Factors such as secularization, religious pluralism, and globalization have generated new challenges for private foundations, and in the aggregate, these developments have contributed to a restructuring within the world of religious philanthropy.  2010 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1201;2010;Period and cohort effects on reports of no religious preference and religious disaffiliation are estimated. Results show that by 2006, the probability of reporting no religious preference had risen to almost .16. Additionally, the growing proportion of Americans raised with no religious preference substantially influences the increase in reporting no religious preference. Two recently developed analysis techniques for disentangling period and cohort effects are used: intrinsic estimator models and cross-classified, random-effects models. Results show (1) period-based increases in the probability of reporting no religious preference from 1990 to 2006, (2) across-cohort increases in no religious preference beginning with those born in the 1940s, and (3) a decline in the likelihood of religious disaffiliation (being raised with a religious preference but currently reporting no religious preference) for those born in the 1960s and 1970s compared to those born between 1945 and 1959.  2010 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1202;2010;Prayer has increasingly been used as an empirical measure of religiosity. Recent developments include Ladd and Spilka's Inward, Outward and Upward Prayer Scale, which measures what respondents think about while praying, and Poloma and Pendleton's Measure of Prayer Type, which measures four different dimensions of prayer as well as degree of intimacy with the divine. The present study provides a factor analytical evaluation of both measures, including an examination of total scale and subscale reliability. The measures were administered to a sample of 518 Irish respondents. Although the total scales and subscales were found to be reliable, confirmatory factor analysis revealed that the hypothesized factor structures were a less than optimal fit of the data, while correlational analysis revealed a conceptual overlap between the measures.  2010 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1203;2010;Recent scholarship asserts that members of racial groups can transcend their ethnic differences, but other research asserts that ethnoracial identities must be reinforced in order to participate in multiracial churches. Analysis of field notes and interview data from a large, black-white Protestant congregation shows that while the core membership of African Americans come specifically for its ethnic and racial diversity, they also look for markers that affirm a distinctive African-American experience. Ethnic reinforcement attracts highly race-conscious participants who eventually move toward processes of ethnic transcendence and congregational integration. The value for researchers is that distinguishing ethnically transcendent and ethnically reinforcing processes encourages the discovery of subtle, racially specific, and continually reinforced affinities that would otherwise remain hidden in seemingly ethnically transcendent settings.  2010 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1204;2010;"Religious affiliation and employment bias is examined in Athens, Greece by implementing an experimental field study. Labor market outcomes (occupation access, entry wage, and wait time for call back) are assessed for three religious minorities (Pentecostal, evangelical, and Jehovah's Witnesses) compared to the religious majority (Greek Orthodox). Results indicate that religious minorities experience employment bias as measured by access to job interviews, entry wages, and wait time for call backs. Moreover, religious minorities face greater constraints on occupational access in more prestigious jobs compared to less prestigious jobs. Occupational access and entry wage bias is highest for religious minority women. In all cases, Jehovah's Witnesses face the greatest bias; female employers offered significantly lower entry wages to Jehovah's Witnesses than male employers.  2010 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1205;2010;Religious congruence refers to consistency among an individual's religious beliefs and attitudes, consistency between religious ideas and behavior, and religious ideas, identities, or schemas that are chronically salient and accessible to individuals across contexts and situations. Decades of anthropological, sociological, and psychological research establish that religious congruence is rare, but much thinking about religion presumes that it is common. The religious congruence fallacy occurs when interpretations or explanations unjustifiably presume religious congruence.  2010 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1206;2010;Research typically defines evangelical belonging as affiliation with an evangelical denomination, but this approach excludes many self-identified evangelicals, even though previous studies of religious groups find that self-identification is a powerful predictor of political preferences. Using data from the National Survey of Religion and Politics, we investigate the usefulness of self-identification for classifying evangelicals. The effects of three types of evangelical belonging (religious tradition-only, self-identification-only, and a combination of religious tradition and self-identification) on respondents' political attitudes, party identification, and vote choice suggest that religious tradition is a good predictor of political attitudes while self-identification is a good predictor of party identification. We conclude that self-identification and tradition are both important to understanding evangelicalism and politics in America.  2010 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1207;2010;Scholars have shown increasing interest in the social implications of Protestant and, specifically, Pentecostal expansion in Latin America over the past several decades. This study uses data from the National Demographic and Health Survey in Brazil to explore the influence of religious affiliation and attendance on the reproductive behavior of unmarried female adolescents (ages 15-19). Results demonstrate that religiously affiliated female adolescents are less likely to have had a child during their teen years when compared with their unaffiliated peers. These protective effects are quite robust for adolescents who claim a Pentecostal affiliation, which is consistent with the doctrine of sanctification, including norms of sexual restraint. Results also demonstrate that teens who attend worship services frequently are significantly less likely to have had a child. These findings augment prior research on religion and fertility while calling attention to the protective effects associated with emergent niches in Brazil's increasingly diversified religious economy.  2010 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1208;2010;Sociologists have paid little attention to the experience of divorce in religious congregations. Numerous quantitative studies suggest that religion can provide health and wellness during such life disruptions, but we know little about the social and individual processes that might foster these benefits. I address this gap in the literature drawing from data collected in a four-year ethnographic study of divorce and ending life partnerships across six religious traditions. I analyze the experiences of 41 individuals who ended life partnerships while active in their congregations. Despite intense points of communal connection through ritual, respondents named largely private strategies for settling heightened emotion, physical and psychological pain, and creating a new self. Permeating their communal experiences was a marked sense of aloneness, resulting from individual shame and congregational silence, as well as their understanding of divorce-work as ultimately private self-work.  2010 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1209;2010;"Studies have attempted to understand the association between more conventional supernatural (religious) beliefs and practices and less conventional "" paranormal"" supernatural beliefs. Some have posited that the two comprise incompatible cultural spheres and belief systems, while others have argued that supernatural religious beliefs are "" small steps"" toward less conventional paranormal views (such as belief in astrology and telekinesis). We build upon recent scholarship outlining a more nuanced, nonlinear relationship between religiosity and paranormal beliefs by identifying a specific niche of believers who are particularly likely to dabble in unconventional supernatural beliefs. Strong believers in the paranormal tend to be characterized by a nonexclusive spiritualist worldview, as opposed to materialist or exclusive religious outlooks. Paranormal believers tend to be characterized by moderate levels of religious belief and practice, and low levels of ideological exclusivity. In general, the relationship between more conventional religiosity and paranormal beliefs is best conceptualized as curvilinear.  2010 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1210;2010;Surveying 2,610 respondents, the Panel Study of American Religion and Ethnicity is a nationally representative in-home survey of the noninstitutionalized U.S. adult population. The survey is designed to (a) focus primarily on religion and spirituality (with over 200 questions on these topics), (b) include multiple other modules (such as health, family relationships, and social ties), (c) oversample African Americans, Asians, and Hispanics, and (d) follow the same respondents over time. We describe the main design features of the survey, present some characteristics of the sample, and provide basic findings. It is our hope that these data will foster more research and contribute to a better understanding of the role and meaning of religion in the contemporary United States.  2010 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1211;2010;"The "" risk-preference"" thesis is a controversial topic in the sociology of religion. Thus far, cross-cultural empirical research on risk preference and religiosity has been meager. This study attempts to replicate Miller's (Miller, Alan S. 2000. Going to hell in Asia: The relationship between risk and religion in a cross cultural setting. Review of Religious Research 42(1):5-18) study for Taiwanese society, using data from the 2007 Taiwan Social Change Survey (TSCS). Logistic regression results show that for the Taiwanese (1) risk preference has little estimated net effect on religious affiliation, but (2) the relationship between risk preference and frequency of religious participation is statistically significant.  2010 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1212;2010;The Golden Rule, a core precept of many religions, emphasizes the importance of treating others with compassion. We examined whether priming Golden Rule messages would influence Buddhists' and Christians' attitudes toward gay people and perceptions that homosexuality is a choice. In a priming task, participants filled in missing words for popular quotations including two Golden Rule messages that were attributed to either Buddha or Jesus. Christians (N = 585) in the Buddha-attributed Golden Rule condition showed stronger explicit anti-gay attitudes and were more likely to agree that homosexuality is a choice than Christians in the Jesus-attributed or control conditions, ?p = .012, = .035, even after controlling for political orientation and religiosity. Buddhists (= 394) showed no variation in attitudes across priming conditions, ?p = .001, = .78. Our results suggest that although the Golden Rule has an important influence on believers, its message of compassion may produce more prejudice if it comes from an outgroup source compared to an ingroup source.  2010 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1213;2010;"The growing literature on multiracial churches tends to take the position that religious values can be influential in promoting racially inclusive religious communities. Marti offers further evidence for this argument: cosmetic changes predominately white churches make to their worship, music, and leadership in order to attract/retain ""race-conscious"" black congregants. In this response, I argue that these churches do not cause blacks to transcend their race consciousness. They merely offer havens for those blacks who have already transcended their race enough to pursue membership in these religious communities. I conclude with a challenge to scholars in this line of research to add evidence of religion's ability to promote racial transcendence for ""race-conscious"" white congregants.  2010 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1214;2010;"The Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches share a similar theology and a hierarchical church administration. Local parish communities are organized in similar ways. However, the Roman Catholic and Orthodox Christian churches occupy different places in the context of American culture, and they have developed distinct notions of priesthood. Findings explore similarities and differences in the attitudes and experience of Catholic and Orthodox clergy. Most striking, the younger clergy (less than 45 years of age) report more conservative attitudes about the priesthood, "" democracy"" in church government, and empowering lay persons in the ministry.  2010 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1215;2010;The study examines the indirect effects of religious fundamentalism on prejudice through cognitive style and fear of invalidity. Undergraduates (n= 199) completed measures of religious fundamentalism, homophobia, modern racism, hostile and benevolent sexism, need for cognition, need for structure, preference for consistency, and fear of invalidity. Need for cognition partially mediated the relationship between religious fundamentalism and both homophobia and benevolent sexism. Preference for consistency partially mediated the relationship between religious fundamentalism and hostile sexism. The indirect effect of religious fundamentalism on modern racism through preference for consistency approached statistical significance. The interaction between need for structure and fear of invalidity partially mediated the relationship between religious fundamentalism and both homophobia and hostile sexism, with individuals high in need for structure and low in fear of invalidity having higher religious fundamentalism and prejudice.  2010 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1216;2010;This article uses multiple-year data to examine charitable giving to organizations that help people in need of food, shelter, or other basic necessities. Families that give to basic necessity organizations in any single year are a mix of occasional givers and regular givers. Controlling for family characteristics that affect giving, giving to basic necessity organizations does not vary across Christian denominations and nonaffiliated families in any notable way. However, Jewish families are both more likely to give and, when they do give, give larger amounts. Given recent policy interest in how churches, synagogues, and mosques help with the voluntary provision of a safety net for people in need, the results draw attention to the importance of a research agenda focused on the differences between occasional givers and regular givers and on explaining why Jewish families give more to organizations that help people in need.  2010 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1217;2010;This experiment examined the effects of online Christian disclosure. Respondents (N = 233) viewed a fictional social networking profile containing one of three levels of Christian disclosure frequency: none, nominal, and extensive. Respondents made few distinctions between nondisclosure and nominal disclosure. Most notably, respondent religiosity moderated impressions. Regardless of disclosure level, religious respondents rated profile owners as more likeable and less stereotypically negative than less religious respondents. The least religious respondents tended to rate the extensively disclosing Christian as least romantically desirable and with more negative stereotyping. The most religious respondents rated the extensively disclosing Christian as most likeable and as most romantically desirable. Christian identity tended to be assumed when not disclosed. Nominal disclosure may constitute a socially acceptable level of online Christian disclosure.  2010 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1218;2010;"This research examines the influence of messages from religious leaders and congregants on whether Korean women are overweight or obese. Data were drawn from telephone interviews with a probability sample (N = 591) of women of Korean descent living in California. Overweight or obese prevalence was measured using World Health Organization standards for Asians (BMI > 23). Respondents reported the frequency of messages discouraging "" excessive eating"" or encouraging "" exercise"" from religious leaders and congregants during a typical month. When conditioned on leaders' messages, the frequency of congregants' messages was associated with a significantly lower probability of being overweight or obese, although messages from either in the absence of the other were unassociated with being overweight or obese. At least for Korean women, religion may help prevent obesity via religious-based social mechanisms. No claim to original US government works."
1219;2010;This study examines the religious participation of Islamic immigrants in Belgium using data from the Migration History and Social Mobility Survey collected in 1994-1996 from 2,200 men who had immigrated from Turkey and Morocco. Religious participation is measured as mosque attendance, fasting during Ramadan, and sacrificing a sheep at the Festival of Sacrifice. Results show that the religious participation of Islamic immigrants depends on both premigration and postmigration characteristics. Religious participation is higher among immigrants who: (1) attended a Koranic school in their country of origin, (2) were socialized in a religious region of their home country, (3) received little schooling, (4) currently live in an area of Belgium with a greater number of mosques, and (5) associate with a high number of co-ethnics. These results suggest that the religious participation of Islamic immigrants in Belgium is an outcome of characteristics unique to immigrants as well as processes common among the general population.  2010 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1220;2010;This study examines the stability of religious preference among people who claim no religious preference in national surveys (i.e., religious nones). Using data from the Faith Matters Study, General Social Survey, and American National Election Study, we show that about 30 percent of religious nones in the first wave of the survey claim an affiliation with a religious group a year later. The percentage of religious nones remained stable in the two waves because a similar number of respondents moved in the opposite direction. Using various measures of religiosity, we show that most of these unstable nones report no significant change in religious belief or practice. We call them liminal nones as they stand halfway in and halfway out of a religious identity. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings on the controversies surrounding the rise of religious nones in recent years.  2010 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1221;2010;This study tests the deregulation hypothesis of religious market theory in 26 European and Northern American countries by examining differences in religious involvement between and within countries. The deregulation hypothesis, which is assumed to be universally valid, predicts that religious involvement is higher in deregulated religious markets. Moreover, countries having deregulated religious markets for a longer period of time are supposed to have higher levels of involvement. Therefore, we test the duration hypothesis. This test is important, as it also has been argued that it may take time for deregulation to have an effect on religious involvement. Multilevel analysis on the stacked European and World Value Surveys of 1981, 1990, 2000, and 2006 show that deregulation fosters church attendance, but duration of deregulation does not increase church attendance. Although the deregulation hypothesis cannot be rejected, we find that modernization corrodes church attendance to a larger extent than deregulation can stimulate church attendance.  2010 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1222;2010;Two major gaps exist in research examining the positive association between religious attendance and happiness. First, scholars have argued that this association may be because of people's perceived relationship with God or the social cohesion one experiences with other parishioners, but scholars have not studied both pathways simultaneously. Using nationally representative cross-sectional data (General Social Survey), I first examine the influence of one's perceived relationship with God and one's perceived social cohesion within the religious community on happiness. One's perceived relationship with God is more strongly associated with happiness than is social cohesion. Second, scholars overwhelmingly use religious attendance as the independent variable, with happiness as the dependent variable. Using two waves of data from a nationally representative panel study (National Survey of Families and Households), I then examine the relationship between religious attendance and happiness over time, finding that religious attendance has a greater effect on happiness than happiness has on religious attendance.  2010 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1223;2010;"Using a sample of college students (N = 904) from the "" Bible Belt,"" this study examines the effect of religiosity and self-control on late adolescents' delay in initiating sexual intercourse or oral sex. Findings from logistic regressions provide evidence that for each one unit increase in self-control, the odds of a male remaining a virgin or of delaying oral sex increased by a factor of 1.82 and 2.84, respectively, while for females, the odds of not engaging in oral sex increased by a factor of 1.67. In addition to the effect of self-control, a one unit increase in religiosity results in the odds of a male remaining a virgin by a factor of 3.86 and 3.30, respectively. For females the odds are increased by a factor of 4.13 and 2.60, respectively. Mediation tests also provided evidence that self-control mediated the effects by religiosity on both dependent measures. Thus, both religiosity and self-control independently and additively function as key social control mechanisms that promote late adolescent health.  2010 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1224;2010;Using data from a 2001-2002 sample of adults aged 65 and older living in the Washington, DC metropolitan area, we examine the associations among religious involvement (as measured by the frequency of attendance at religious services and praying), the belief in divine control, and the sense of mattering-a key component of the self-concept. We also assess the extent to which these patterns vary by gender, race, and education. Findings indicate indirect effects of religious attendance on mattering through divine control beliefs and the frequency of social contact. Praying increases mattering indirectly only through divine control beliefs. Moreover, divine control beliefs are more strongly associated with mattering among women, African Americans, and individuals with less education. We discuss the contribution of these findings for theory about the links between religious involvement, beliefs about God, and psychosocial resources, and the influence of core dimensions of social status and stratification.  2010 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1225;2010;"Using data from the Health and Retirement Study, I examine the relationship between adult mortality and religious affiliation. I test whether mortality differences associated with religious affiliation can be attributed to differences in socioeconomic status (years of education and household wealth), attendance at religious services, or health behaviors, particularly cigarette and alcohol consumption. A baseline report of attendance at religious services is used to avoid confounding effects of deteriorating health. Socioeconomic status explains some but not all of the mortality difference. While Catholics, evangelical Protestants, and black Protestants benefit from favorable attendance patterns, attendance (or lack of) at services explains much of the higher mortality of those with no religious preference. Health behaviors do not mediate the relationship between mortality and religion, except among evangelical Protestants. Not only does religion matter, but studies examining the effect of ""religiosity"" need to consider differences by religious affiliation.  2010 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1226;2010;"Using data from the International Social Survey Program and the World Values Survey about current and former religious adherence, we calculate country-level religious-conversion rates for 40 countries. Drawing upon a theoretical model based on rational individual choice, we posit that the frequency of religious conversion depends on the cost of switching and the cost of having the "" wrong"" religion. Findings accord with several hypotheses: religious-conversion rates are positively related to religious pluralism, gauged by adherence shares; negatively related to government restrictions on religious conversion; positively related to levels of education; and negatively related to a history of Communism. Conversion rates are not related to per capita GDP, the presence of state religion, and the extent of religiosity. Effects from the types of religious adherence are minor, except for the negative effect of Muslim adherence.  2010 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1227;2010;"Using data from the nationally representative Religion and Diversity Survey, Americans' responses to religious diversity are examined at the national and community levels. While an overwhelming majority of Americans agree that religious diversity has been good for the nation, support for the inclusion of non-Christians in community life is mixed. Theological exclusivism is consistently and strongly associated with negative attitudes toward religious diversity and less willingness to include Muslims and Hindus in community life. Belief that the United States is a Christian nation is associated with a positive view of religious diversity but decreased willingness to include Muslims in community life. Prior contact with Muslims, Buddhists, and Hindus is predictive of more positive views of religious diversity; contact with Muslims is associated with greater tolerance for a mosque in one's community.  2010 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1228;2010;Using Ireland, which experienced an economic boom in the mid 1990s, as a case study, the negative association between economic growth and religious practice is examined by testing two competing hypotheses. Secularization theory argues that the cultural changes that accompany economic growth lead to a decline in religious values. As religious values diminish, so does attendance at religious services. An alternative explanation is that economic growth increases individual purchasing power and therefore consumption-related behavior. Consumption supplants religion by providing alternative intermediaries (symbols, infrastructures, and practices) for social behavior, but only marginally affects religious values. Using data from the 1988 to 2005 International Social Survey Programme (ISSP), analyses show that the economic boom in Ireland was clearly associated with a decline in religious attendance, while religious values remained stable. Thus, in Ireland the consequences of economic growth deviate from the predictions of secularization theory and therefore support the consumption argument.  2010 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1229;2010;We provide a cohort-component projection of the religious composition of the United States, considering differences in fertility, migration, intergenerational religious transmission, and switching among 11 ethnoreligious groups. If fertility and migration trends continue, Hispanic Catholics will experience rapid growth and expand from 10 to 18 percent of the American population between 2003 and 2043. Protestants are projected to decrease from 47 to 39 percent over the same period, while Catholicism emerges as the largest religion among the youngest age cohorts. Liberal Protestants decline relative to other groups due to low fertility and losses from religious switching. Immigration drives growth among Hindus and Muslims, while low fertility and a mature age structure causes Jewish decline. The low fertility of secular Americans and the religiosity of immigrants provide a countervailing force to secularization, causing the nonreligious population share to peak before 2043.  2010 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1230;2010;We theoretically and empirically evaluate Allport's intrinsic-extrinsic and Batson's quest religious orientations through the lens of self-determination theory (SDT) and Wulff's social-cognitive model. Confirming our theoretical analysis, we find that Allport's intrinsic-extrinsic dichotomy fails to correspond empirically to the differentiation between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation within SDT. Whereas Allport's intrinsic religious orientation was positively related to internalized extrinsic motivation, his two extrinsic (i.e., personal and social) religious orientations were not systematically related to any of the discerned motives within SDT. Furthermore, Batson's quest orientation was unrelated to any of the SDT concepts but was positively related to symbolic disbelief. The present findings suggest that Allport's motivational orientations model needs both refinement and relabeling to better fit with recent theoretical evolutions in the field of motivational psychology.  2010 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1231;2011;According to the General Social Survey, the combined rate of weekly and monthly attendance at religious services in Canada has declined by about 20 points from 1986 to 2008. Approximately half of this decline stems from the increase in the proportion of people reporting no religion, who, for the most part, do not attend religious services. The other portion of this decline is attributable to eroding attendance rates among Catholics, particularly older Catholics, and Protestants in Qubec. Attendance rates for Protestants outside of Qubec show signs of increase. The reported increase in weekly attendance in Canada by the Project Canada surveys and cited by Bibby as a possible indicator of a religious renaissance is revealed as an artifact in the data due to an oversample of Protestants. I find another weighting problem in the Canadian Survey of Giving, Volunteering and Participating that leads to underestimates of aggregate religious attendance rates.  2011 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1232;2011;Achterberg and colleagues conclude there is in train a significant change toward deprivatization in Europe. In the late 1990s Christians were more pro public religion in countries where they were least numerous and in the Netherlands in particular there had been an increasing difference in attitudes between believers and nonbelievers over 25 years. Examining more recent survey data on British attitudes (1998 and 2008), we find a firm consensus among the nonreligious against religion having a high public profile, while Christians are more likely to object to antireligion sentiment and people belonging to non-Christian religions are more likely to support public religion. Nonreligious people appear to be no more hostile now than in the late 1990s, and where there has been a decrease in sympathy for public religion it is among religious groups.  2011 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1233;2011;Analysis of interviews with 275 natural and social scientists at 21 elite U.S. research universities suggests that only a minority of scientists see religion and science as always in conflict. Scientists selectively employ different cultural strategies with regards to the religion-science relationship: redefining categories (the use of institutional resources from religion and from science), integration models (scientists strategically employ the views of major scientific actors to legitimate a more symbiotic relationship between science and religion), and intentional talk (scientists actively engage in discussions about the boundaries between science and religion). Such results challenge narrow conceptions of secularization theory and the sociology of science literature by describing ways science intersects with other knowledge categories. Most broadly the ways that institutions and ideologies shape one another through the agency of individual actors within those institutions is explored.  2011 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1234;2011;argues that much of the work in the sociology of religion is susceptible to the religious congruence fallacy-the tendency to assume consistency between religious beliefs and one's attitudes and behaviors across situations when they are in fact highly variable. We build on and extend this argument by focusing on intersecting group identities as a mechanism for identifying such incongruence, not only within religious contexts, but also at the intersection of categories such as gender and race. To illustrate this argument, the analysis draws on data from the 2006 Panel Study of American Religion and Ethnicity (PS-ARE) to assess how race, gender, and religion interact to produce different levels of attitude and behavior incongruencies on key issues of the day, specifically conservative social values and voting behaviors. The results find marked differences and inconsistent relationships between attitudes and behaviors across racial-gender groups. We use the analysis to highlight the conditions that result in incongruence at the intersections of identity categories and pinpoint where social scientists are most vulnerable to committing the congruence fallacy.  2011 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1235;2011;As the religious landscape of the United States becomes increasingly diverse, understanding how individuals of different faiths relate to each other and the consequences of those relationships presents a significant issue for research. Research studying such faith-bridging interactions has been limited and primarily focused on interfaith marriage. Using social network data from the 2004 General Social Survey we examine the dynamics underlying the frequency of interfaith ties of all types. We then analyze how interreligious ties differ in strength from intrareligious ties.  2011 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1236;2011;Based on terror management theory, previous research has shown that terrorism threat increases prejudice against Muslims and is mediated by death-related thoughts. Because this effect was found on a correlational level, it remains unclear whether terrorism threat increases prejudice against Muslims because of enhanced death-related thoughts or the opposite: terrorism threat increases death-related thoughts because of stronger prejudice against Muslims. To disentangle this shortcoming, we varied death-related thoughts by systematically manipulating the belief in literal immortality. Using two studies, we found that participants exposed to terrorism pictures (vs. controls) had increased prejudice against both Muslims (Study 1) and immigrants (Study 2) when they were led to believe that literal immortality does not exist but not when they were led to believe that it does exist. Mediation analysis indicated that this effect was mediated by death-related thoughts. This provides further evidence that terrorism threat increases prejudice because of death-related thoughts.  2011 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1237;2011;Debates about religion and educational attainment often assume that members of certain religious groups do not seek out knowledge of science because they are opposed to the use of the scientific method. Using the science module of the 2006 General Social Survey, the analysis indicates that no religious group differs from the nonreligious comparison group in its propensity to seek out scientific knowledge. A more subtle epistemological conflict may arise when scientists make claims that explicitly contradict theological accounts. Findings indicate that Protestants and Catholics differ from the comparison group only on the very few issues where religion and science make competing claims. A third possible source of conflict may not be epistemological, but rather derives from opposition to what is understood as the public moral agenda of scientists. Findings indicate that conservative Protestants are opposed to scientific influence in public affairs due to opposition to the scientists' moral agenda.  2011 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1238;2011;Denominational differences in the number of scientists produced in Germany during the period 1550 to 1900 are linked to the historical impact of Catholic celibate and Protestant noncelibate clergy households. Protestant leadership in science is largely attributable to the development of a new social mobility pattern among descendants of their clergy that enhanced the pastorate's ability to convey cultural and social capital to their marrying offspring, something denied to Catholic clergy. By reference to German historical developments, I show that the contributions of clerical households, far from being limited to the natural sciences, were equally in evidence across most other areas of scholarly endeavor. A discussion of the theoretical implications of these findings provides a comparative analysis of Protestant to Catholic scholarly achievements in general, and of scientific achievements in particular, as well as a critical assessment of Robert K. Merton's theorizing on the subject.  2011 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1239;2011;Despite voluminous research examining religion as an integrative force and a mechanism of social control, relatively few studies have examined the association between religion and proscribed or morally ambiguous behaviors beyond crime and drug use. The present exploratory study examines the role of religion, at both the individual and county levels, in predicting self-reported gambling problems. Hierarchical linear models are employed to examine religion and self-reported gambling problems using the restricted use data of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. A negative association between religious attendance and problem gambling (at the individual level) is strongest when church adherents per capita is relatively high (measured at the county level). However, when the number of conservative Protestants per capita is relatively high, religious attendance (measured at the individual level) is associated with an increased risk of gambling problems. These countervailing findings are interpreted as supportive of the bonding and bridging capital thesis.  2011 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1240;2011;"Drawing on ethnographic and interview data collected in El Salvador and South Africa over a four-year period, this article uses a social constructionist approach to describe two types of interaction between short-term mission teams and their hosts. First, hosts encounter the flow of teams as foreign social products. Once they internalize this new part of their social reality, hosts seek to recruit and control teams. They also mimic the practice of short-term missions, sending their own teams to remote locations. Second, hosts interact directly with visitors, engaging in world-building activities that create transnational religious ties. Short-term missions thus make residents of the new centers of Christianity more mobile in Christianity's global civil society and increase the number of ties between Christians across borders. These findings have implications for the scholarly debate about how to conceptualize Global Christianity; they also broaden the scope of the emerging discourse on short-term missions.  2011 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1241;2011;Examinations of culture wars typically assess the attitudes of the American public. This study instead focuses on culture wars among religious elites-clergy-and tests three aspects of the culture wars thesis: (1) whether religious elites are engaged in culture wars, (2) whether clergy attitudes are polarized on these issues, and (3) whether religious authority or religious affiliation is more salient in creating culture wars cleavages. Using data from a large random sample of Protestant clergy, we find a substantial amount of engagement in culture wars by all types of Protestant clergy. The amount of polarization is more attributable to views of religious authority (i.e., biblical inerrancy) than to religious tradition. Moreover, polarization among clergy is somewhat more evident on culture wars issues than on other social and political issues. These findings are generally supportive of the culture wars thesis and should help return examinations of culture wars back to where they were originally theorized to be waged: among elites.  2011 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1242;2011;"Faith-based organizations might be ideal social service providers, claiming to transform clients' lives with holistic support while meeting immediate needs. While organizations have such goals, their success is impacted by constituencies with differing goals for the organization. Clients with goals not commensurate with an organization's may compromise its ability to attain its goals. Three questions are examined here: What are the goals of faith-based service providers? When asked what they think about the services, do clients share the organizational goals? Are organizations likely to meet either set of goals? Homeless persons patronizing faith-based soup kitchens were interviewed; service activities of organizations were observed. Clients' goals focused on survival in their current situation. Organizations' goals ranged from meeting clients' immediate needs to transforming clients through spiritual restoration. Congregations studied met clients' immediate needs. However, clients' accommodational goals were potentially problematic for organizations with spiritual goals.  2011 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1243;2011;"Four conceptual and methodological edges or areas of study are outlined. They are located near what have been the boundaries between the sociology of religion and other subfields, where we believe a potential exists to encourage a wide range of scholars to revisit some central concepts. Paying attention to these edges-as a means to de-center to re-center our debates in new ways-not only broadens and deepens our knowledge of the ""religious,"" it encourages us to reexamine long-standing conceptual tools, unquestioned assumptions, and accepted methods in the sociology of religion. We illustrate these edges through a review of recent literature and examples drawn from our current empirical projects.  2011 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1244;2011;"Four perspectives (moral community thesis, religious integration, religious commitment, and social networks) guide the selection of variables in this study. Data are from the combined World Values/European Values Surveys for 2000 (50,547 individuals nested in 56 nations). The results of a multivariate hierarchical linear model support all four perspectives. Persons residing in nations with relatively high levels of religiosity, who are affiliated with one of four major faiths, are religiously committed, and are engaged with a religious network are found to be lower in suicide acceptability. The religious integration perspective, in particular, is empirically supported; affiliation with Islam is associated with low suicide acceptability. The findings provide strong support for an integrated model and demonstrate the usefulness of the moral community thesis in understanding suicide acceptability.  2011 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1245;2011;"Global processes present a challenge for scholarly work on religion, necessitating new concepts, theoretical and analytical models, intellectual sensitivity, and imagination. This calls for focusing on (1) cross-border interpenetration of religious organizations, beliefs, and practices; (2) variations in the potential for religious beliefs and institutions to be transported; and (3) the use of multiple frames of reference to examine the dispersion of religious cultures and communities. A presidential panel presents the need for generating new research questions, improving measurement tools, and updating methodological techniques so that social scientists of religion accurately and authentically portray the nature and expression of religion in the 21st century.  2011 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1246;2011;"Huntington claimed that today's major conflicts are most likely to erupt between religiously defined ""civilizations,"" in particular between Christianity and Islam. Using World Values Surveys from 86 nations, we examine differences between Christians and Muslims in preferences for religious political leaders. The results suggest a marked difference between Muslims and Christians in their attitudes toward religious politicians, with Muslims more favorable by 20 points out of 100. Devoutness, education, degree of government corruption, and status as a formerly Communist state account for the difference. Little support is found for the clash-of-civilizations hypothesis. Instead, we find that a clash of individual beliefs-between the devout and the secular-along with enduring differences between the more developed and less developed world explains the difference between Islam and Christianity with regards to preferences for religious political leaders.  2011 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1247;2011;"In research on religiosity and prejudice, right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) has been studied alongside variables such as fundamentalism and orthodoxy. Four concerns regarding research on the relationship between RWA and religiosity are identified: (1) the overlap of religiosity and prejudice within the RWA scale; (2) the inflation of relationships by correlating part-whole measures; (3) covariation in the extremes of the construct hiding the possible independence of components within RWA; and (4) statistical artifacts arising in multiple regression from the combination of these factors. We elaborate these four issues and then demonstrate how they can lead to different interpretations of some previously published data. The article concludes with suggestions for the management and resolution of these issues that may allow RWA to continue to be used in religiosity and prejudice research and how it might evolve to become the boon to researchers that they seek.  2011 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1248;2011;In the study of mysticism the debate has centered on whether a universal experiential core exists regardless of religious interpretation. The current investigation combines Jamesian empiricist and social constructivist perspectives to argue that stable experiential facets load variously on factors to construct local interpretations. Local interpretations reflect a family resemblance-a mystical common core experienced across cultures. Results of confirmatory factor analyses, based on data from 240 Tibetan Buddhist adults, suggest statistical model fit and superiority for the three-factor model compared to the unidimensional model. Pure experience can be distinguished explicitly from its context-specific hermeneutical construal.  2011 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1249;2011;Numerous theories of religion rest on the assumption that the religious composition of local populations influences the religious identities of a person's close friends, but there have been few empirical tests of this assumption. Using a combination of data on the religious identity of close friends (from the 1988 and 1998 General Social Survey) and information on the religious composition of counties (from the U.S. Religious Congregations and Membership Study) we find that despite tendencies toward religious homogeneity, the religious composition of the surrounding population has an effect on the proportion of a respondent's same-religion friends and on the proportion of friends belonging to specific other religious groups. Local population characteristics are unrelated to the proportion of respondents' friends known in congregational settings. Results have implications for a broad range of sociological theories of religion as well as research examining the impact of same-congregation and same-religion friends (e.g., health and well-being).  2011 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1250;2011;Opportunities for legal gambling of various types have expanded rapidly in the United States in recent years. Our study develops a series of theoretical arguments linking multiple dimensions of religious involvement-traditions, beliefs, practices, and networks-with the frequency of gambling activity. Relevant hypotheses are then tested using data from the Panel Study of American Religion and Ethnicity (PS-ARE), a recent nationwide probability sample of U.S. adults. Findings underscore the importance of co-religionist networks in deterring gambling. In addition, biblical inerrantists and members of conservative Protestant and sectarian groups are relatively disinclined to gamble. Religious attendance is also inversely associated with gambling frequency. Differences in gambling by religious tradition are amplified among persons with strong co-religionist networks. Several study limitations are noted, and promising future research directions on the dynamics and functioning of church-based networks are identified.  2011 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1251;2011;"Previous research on charitable giving has identified a significant relationship between political conservatism and greater financial giving to charitable causes. Yet that research has not adequately explored the important role of religion in that relationship, nor differences in financial giving targets (i.e., religious congregations, noncongregational religious organizations, and nonreligious organizations). Support for competing theories concerning political ideology, religious practice, and charitable financial giving is assessed using data from the Panel Study on American Ethnicity and Religion (PS-ARE). For both religious and nonreligious giving, the effect of political ideology is completely mediated by participation in religious and civic practices. These findings support recent arguments on ""practice theory"" in cultural sociology and suggest that it is less the effect of ideology than of active participation in religious, political, and community organizations that explains Americans' financial giving to religious and nonreligious organizations.  2011 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1252;2011;Religious short-term mission trips are an increasingly popular form of American religious practice, especially among young people. Both organizers and participants often emphasize their transformative nature. However, scholarly efforts to evaluate systematically the social consequences of religious short-term mission trips are lacking. To address this neglect, our article investigates whether going on a religious short-term mission trip significantly differentiates youth who engage in civic actions from those who do not. Based on quantitative analysis of Wave I of the National Survey of Youth Religion (NSYR), we find that, controlling for other important factors, taking a mission trip significantly increases the likelihood of adolescents participating in various forms of civic activity, particularly religious-based volunteer work. Drawing on prior scholarship on religious short-term mission and similarly focused trips and in-depth interview data from trip participants, we outline several theoretical mechanisms that likely explain the link between taking a mission trip and civic engagement.  2011 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1253;2011;Talk is easily regarded as having lesser value in studies of social phenomena than action, interaction, and organization. Yet talk is an important way in which humans act, interact, and organize themselves. In this article, I examine how talk has been used in recent decades in the study of religion and in related work on culture and institutions. I argue that careful empirical examination of talk has already significantly increased our understanding of both the micro and macro processes involved in the construction of social life. I discuss four objections to taking talk seriously and show that these objections should not deter investigations in which talk plays a central role. I offer examples of recent work that poses new conceptual and theoretical questions, complements quantitative studies, and provides insights about changing historical and contemporary social conditions.  2011 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1254;2011;The ambivalent response of many black churches to current social issues has caused some scholars to question the centrality of black churches within African-American communities. Using a nationally representative sample of black congregations, this study engages the debate about the institutional centrality of black churches by focusing on their response to HIV/AIDS. Although many congregational studies treat black churches as a monolithic whole, this analysis identifies heterogeneity among black churches that shapes their responsiveness to social issues. Contrary to prior claims, a congregation's liberal-conservative ideological orientation does not significantly affect its likelihood of having an HIV/AIDS program. Beyond assessing churches' internal characteristics, this study uses institutional theory to analyze churches as open systems that can be influenced by their surrounding environment. It demonstrates that externally engaged congregations are significantly more likely to have a program. These results indicate that black churches maintain institutional centrality by engaging their external environment.  2011 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1255;2011;"The cognitive science of religion (CSR) arose out of attempts to ""science up"" religious studies and the anthropology of religion without eliminating interpretive approaches. While maintaining this historical orientation, CSR holds promise to help bridge to other areas within the scientific study of religion. Particularly fruitful areas of future collaboration and complementary study are evolutionary studies of religion, psychology of religion, sociology of religion, and archeology of religion. In response to an invitation to explore the potential of CSR for the 50th anniversary of this journal, I briefly summarize CSR's history and current state and then offer exemplary future directions that might bring CSR into fruitful connection with other areas in the greater scientific study of religion.  2011 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1256;2011;"The difference between religious service attendance measured using conventional surveys and time diaries has been attributed to identity processes; a high level of religious identity importance may prompt overreporting on a survey question. This article tests the hypothesized role of identity importance as an individual determinant of overreporting and the result of socially desirable behavior. A time diary measure of attendance (from the American Time Use Study 2003-2008) is imputed for conventional survey data (from the General Social Survey 2002-2008) using the multiple imputation for multiple studies procedure (). Logistic regression models predicting self-reported attendance and overreported attendance are estimated using identity importance as a key covariate and controlling for demographic variables associated with attendance. Identity importance is a strong predictor of both self-reported and overreported attendance. Attendance, while a biased measure of actual behavior, may be a good indicator of religiosity.  2011 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1257;2011;The meaning of traditional and alternative measures of religiosity in a majority Muslim context is examined using the Islamic Social Attitudes Survey (ISAS). Specifically, this article reports a test of whether traditional religiosity measures are useful in a majority Muslim context. Differences between men and women are explored as well as the extent to which demographics, schools of thought, and religious socialization are significantly correlated to religious salience and religious experience. Results suggest the need to use alternative measures of Islamic religiosity and to take gender difference into account. Islamist political affiliation and religious socialization are positively associated with religious salience and experience for women, while more traditional measures such as mosque attendance and Qur'anic reading are associated with religious salience and experience for men, even after controlling for religious sect.  2011 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1258;2011;The organizational niche, a fruitful concept from the organizational ecology literature, frames this study on the diverse orthodoxy of congregations within the same denomination. Congregations diversify along a conservative-to-liberal continuum, which lessens niche overlap with nearby congregations in their denomination. Pastors and priests in United Methodist and Episcopal congregations in three U.S. regions were able to locate their congregations (and other congregations in their denomination in close proximity) along this conservative-to-liberal continuum, an indication that orthodoxy distinctions were important to congregational identity. In comparison, Assemblies of God congregations showed little intradenominational diversity in orthodoxy, since sectarian boundaries narrow their niche. Theoretical and methodological implications of this intradenominational diversity are explored.  2011 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1259;2011;"The purpose of this study is to explain how church-based emotional support influences the health of older Mexican Americans. This issue is evaluated with a theoretical model that contains the following core linkages: (1) older Mexican Americans who go to church more often will be more likely to receive emotional support from fellow church members; (2) older Mexican Americans who receive more support from their fellow church members will be more likely to feel they belong in their congregation; (3) older Mexican Americans who feel they belong in their congregation are likely to have a stronger sense of personal control; and (4) older Mexican Americans who have a stronger sense of personal control are likely to enjoy better health. Data from a recent nationwide survey of older Mexican Americans provide support for each of these relationships.  2011 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1260;2011;"The relationship between education and the importance of religion in everyday decision making is examined using data from two national surveys of American adults. People who have higher levels of education are less likely to rely on the Bible and the teachings of their place of worship for guidance in their decision making. However, previously undocumented contingencies attenuate the effect of education: (1) attending religious services regularly; (2) involvement in religious activities; (3) praying more frequently; (4) believing in the literal interpretation of the Bible; and (5) greater certainty in one's personal faith. These patterns hold net of income, which is also negatively associated with religious-based decision making-and only the socially integrative aspects of religiousness attenuate that association.  2011 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."

Religion seems to influence the overall level of educational ideals. Both before and after controls, Taiwanese Protestants have the highest educational ideals for both boys and girls; the nonreligious have the second highest ideals. Members of the new religious movement Yi-Guan-Dao and Catholics have the lowest ideals, while folk religionists/Taoists and Buddhists are in the middle and not significantly different from each other. We discuss possible mechanisms of influence and how our findings speak to the available literature on religion and education in the United States and elsewhere.  2011 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1262;2011;The relationship between religious obligations and female genital cutting is explored using data from Burkina Faso, a religiously and ethnically diverse country where approximately three-quarters of adult women are circumcised. Data from the 2003 Burkina Faso Demographic and Health Survey are used to estimate multilevel models of religious variation in the intergenerational transmission of female genital cutting. Differences between Christians, Muslims, and adherents of traditional religions are reported, along with an assessment of the extent to which individual and community characteristics account for religious differences. Religious variation in the intergenerational transmission of female genital cutting is largely explained by specific religious beliefs and by contextual rather than individual characteristics. Although Muslim women are more likely to have their daughters circumcised, the findings suggest the importance of a collective rather than individual Muslim identity for the continuation of the practice.  2011 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1263;2011;"The transition from adolescence into emerging adulthood is usually accompanied by a decline in religious participation. This article examines why such decline occurs at different rates across major Christian traditions and whether this variation can be explained by early socialization factors. Using data from waves 1 and 3 of the National Study of Youth and Religion (N = 1,879), I examine the effects of parental religiosity, church support, religious education, and youth group involvement on the decline in attendance five years later. Results show that these socialization processes adequately explain why attendance declines at different rates across religious traditions. However, these socialization factors do not have the same effect across traditions and often yield differential returns for attendance outcomes. These findings also suggest that comparisons across religious traditions can resolve the ""channeling hypothesis"" debate about whether parental influence on an offspring's future religiosity is primarily direct or indirect.  2011 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1264;2011;"This article reviews various theoretical approaches political scientists employ in the analysis of religion and politics and posits culture as a conceptual bridge between competing approaches. After coming to the study of religion slowly in comparison with other social science disciplines, political science finally has a theoretically diverse and thriving religion and politics subfield. However, political scientists' contributions to the social scientific study of religion are hampered by a lack of agreement about whether endogenous or exogenous theoretical approaches ought to dominate our scholarship. I assert that the concept of culture-and more specifically, subculture-might help create more connections across theoretical research traditions. I emphasize how the concept of religion-based subculture is inherent in psychological, social psychological, social movement, and contextual approaches to religion and politics scholarship, and I explore these theoretical connections using the example of religion-based ""us versus them"" discourses in contemporary American politics.  2011 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1265;2011;This research examines how undergraduates perceive the relationship between religion and science and the factors that shape those perceptions. Longitudinal data generated from the Spirituality in Higher Education Project representing a national sample of undergraduates is analyzed. The analysis finds that, despite the seeming predominance of a conflict-oriented narrative, the majority of undergraduates do not view the relationship between these two institutions as one of conflict. Undergraduate students are also more likely to move away from a conflict perspective than to adopt one during their college years. However, there are significant differences across fields of study and levels of religiosity. Students in the education and business fields, for example, are most likely to adopt a pro-religion conflict stance during college. Future research might examine the mechanisms that lead students in some fields towards or away from a conflict perspective.  2011 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1266;2011;This study examines cross-national differences in the religiosity of immigrants in Europe utilizing three different measures of religiosity: religious attendance, praying, and subjective religiosity. Hypotheses are formulated by drawing upon a variety of theories-scientific worldview, insecurity, religious markets, and social integration. The hypotheses are tested using European Social Survey data (2002-2008) from more than 10,000 first-generation immigrants living in 27 receiving countries. Multilevel models show that, on the individual level, religiosity is higher among immigrants who are unemployed, less educated, and who have recently arrived in the host country. On the contextual level, the religiosity of natives positively affects immigrant religiosity. The models explain about 60 percent of the cross-national differences in religious attendance and praying of immigrants and about 20 percent of the cross-national differences in subjective religiosity.  2011 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1267;2011;This study examines popular and scholarly perceptions that young American evangelicals are becoming more liberal than older evangelicals. Young evangelicals are more likely to have more liberal attitudes on same-sex marriage, premarital sex, cohabitating, and pornography, but not abortion. This analysis is situated within the theoretical context of emerging adulthood, and considers higher education, delayed marriage, and shifts in moral authority as potential mediating factors accounting for age differences. A new method for operationalizing evangelical as a religious identity is suggested and three different classification schemes are examined: religious tradition, self-identified evangelicals, and theologically conservative Protestants. The data come from the 2006 Panel Study of American Religion and Ethnicity.  2011 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1268;2011;This study examines the association between religion and attitudes toward the practice of abortion and abortion policy in Brazil. Drawing upon data from the 2002 Brazilian Social Research Survey (BSRS), we test a number of hypotheses with regard to the role of religion on opposition to the practice of abortion and its legalization. Findings indicate that frequently attending Pentecostals demonstrate the strongest opposition to the practice of abortion and both frequently attending Pentecostals and Catholics demonstrate the strongest opposition to its legalization. Additional religious factors, such as a commitment to biblical literalism, were also found to be significantly associated with opposition to both abortion issues. Ultimately, the findings have implications for the future of public policy on abortion and other contentious social issues in Brazil.  2011 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1269;2011;This study examines the impact of educational enrollment and attainment on several measures of religious belief using nationally representative panel data. Although college does not appear to substantially alter the religious beliefs of most emerging adults, findings do reveal a modest increase in skepticism toward super-empirical religious beliefs among college students and graduates compared to those who have never attended any form of postsecondary education. This effect is dependent on college type, with students attending elite universities exhibiting the greatest increase in skepticism. Apart from changes in super-empirical belief, graduating from college modestly increases preferences for institutionalized religion while simultaneously reducing adherence to exclusivist religious belief. Faculty commitment to secularism, the degree of student academic engagement, and developing social identities may play a role in religious belief change, particularly at elite universities.  2011 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1270;2011;This study explores the phenomenological structure of mystical experience among 139 Chinese Pure Land and Chan Buddhist monks and nuns. Semi-structured interviews, thematic coding, and statistical analyses demonstrated that Stace's common facets of mysticism as measured by Hood's Mysticism Scale (M Scale) successfully described Buddhist experience as modified by Buddhist doctrines. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) revealed that these facets could be formed into Stace's three-factor structure. A mystical introvertive unity hypothesized to be separate from an extrovertive unity instead converged in the Chinese Buddhist context. These results lend strong support to the thesis that the phenomenology of mystical experience reveals a common experiential core that can be discerned across religious and spiritual traditions. These data also demonstrated that this common core can and should be explored using mixed methods.  2011 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1271;2011;This study measured the prevalence of religious self-disclosure in public MySpace profiles that belonged to a subsample of National Study of Youth and Religion (NSYR) wave 3 respondents (N = 560). Personal attributes associated with religious identification as well as the overall quantity of religious self-disclosures are examined. A majority (62 percent) of profile owners identified their religious affiliations online, although relatively few profile owners (30 percent) said anything about religion outside the religion-designated field. Most affiliation reports (80 percent) were consistent with the profile owner's reported affiliation on the survey. Religious profile owners disclosed more about religion when they also believed that religion is a public matter or if they evaluated organized religion positively. Evangelical Protestants said more about religion than other respondents. Religiosity, believing that religion is a public matter, and the religiosity of profile owners' friendship group were all positively associated with religious identification and self-disclosure.  2011 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1272;2011;Three questions are addressed concerning the relationship of Jewish identity to secular achievements. Are the secular achievements of American Jews related at all to the strength of their Jewish identity? Which has a stronger relationship to secular achievement, a religious or an ethnic Jewish identity? Do communal aspects or private, personal aspects of Jewish identity have the stronger relationship to secular achievements? Using the 2000-2001 National Jewish Population Survey, we find that educational attainment, labor force participation, and occupational achievements are related to several expressions of Jewish identity, even after controlling for the traditional sources of variation (age, gender, education, family status). Jewish identity, as expressed in terms of religion, ethnicity, communal commitment, and private attitudes and practices, is related to contemporary Jewish secular achievement, albeit differently for men and women.  2011 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1273;2011;Through in-depth interviews with scientists at elite academic institutions-those particularly likely to have no firm belief in God-we provide insight into the motives scientists who are not religious have for joining a religious group and the struggle faced by these individuals in reconciling personal beliefs with what they consider the best interests of their families. Narratives stress the use of resources from identities as scientists to provide their children with religious choices consistent with science and in negotiating spousal influence and a desire for community. Findings expand the religious socialization and identities literatures by widening the range of understanding of the strategies parents utilize to interface with religious communities as well as lead to more nuanced public understanding of how atheist and agnostic scientists relate to religious communities.  2011 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1274;2011;Two distinct research traditions have established that (a) religiosity implies prosocial tendencies, though limited to proximal targets, and (b) religious fundamentalism (RF) relates to prejudice, often because of underlying right-wing authoritarianism (RWA). Through two studies, we investigated the idea that RF, due to underlying religiosity, also predicts prosociality that is limited to proximal rather than distal targets. Specifically, we found that RF, unlike RWA and because of religiosity, predicted prosociality towards a nonfeminist but not a feminist target in need (Experiment 1) and willingness to help friends but not unknown people in need in the same hypothetical situations (Experiment 2). Moreover, like RWA, RF implied negative attitudes towards the feminist. This limited, not extended, prosociality of people scoring high on RF was in contrast with their self-perceptions of being universally altruistic. Fundamentalism seems to combine religiosity's qualities (in-group prosociality) with authoritarianism's defects (out-group derogation).  2011 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1275;2011;Two models seeking to explain the growth and decline of religious groups are prevalent in the literature. The religious market approach emphasizes the role of intergroup competition and in doing so focuses on religious switching. Another perspective emphasizes demographic mechanisms, particularly fertility. Research to date has not considered how switching and fertility interact as mechanisms of growth. Switching and fertility share a significant role in the growth trajectory of a religious group. Early success in gaining members through switching has an important long-term impact, which fertility alone cannot produce. The age of those switching into a group can also have significant consequences for the effects of fertility.  2011 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1276;2011;Using a longitudinal sample of over 14,000 undergraduate students, this study explores whether and how students' religious transformations during the college years are associated with their religious affiliation, religious experiences, and the institutional characteristics of their college or university. Hierarchical linear modeling reveals that students from religious majority groups (i.e., mainline and evangelical Protestants) generally experience increased religious commitment and decreased religious skepticism as compared with students from religious minority groups. Interestingly, though, students from these majority groups also report greater levels of religious struggle compared to minority group students. Moreover, institutional religious affiliation and an inclusive campus religious climate often attenuate the relationship between students' religious affiliation and their religious transformation. Environments at both the macro (campus) and micro (friendship groups) levels contribute critically to young adults' religious commitment.  2011 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1277;2011;"Using attendance data from a declining Episcopal church and a growing Lutheran church in a medium-sized midwestern city, we explore the issue of seasonality in church attendance from the 1940s to the late 2000s. Our central concern is whether month-to-month variation in church attendance has remained the same or changed over the period of time under consideration. We find remarkable consistency in the overall month-to-month attendance pattern over the course of the past seven decades but less variation in attendance from month to month in more recent decades in both churches. We argue that the findings demonstrate the presence of a ""committed core"" of church members who attend regularly and the departure of nominal members who have swelled the ranks of the ""nones"" in recent decades.  2011 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1278;2011;"Various explanations have been given for the positive association between religiosity and physical health. Using data from two waves of the National Survey of Midlife in the United States (1995, 2005) and retrospective data on the importance of religion in the home in which respondents were raised we find that psychological resources, operationalized by measures of emotional and psychological well-being, mediate the effect of this early exposure to religion but only on self-rated health and physical symptomatology; chronic illnesses and health limitations on activities of daily living are unaffected.  2011 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1279;2011;While once the archetypical outsiders, most Jews today do not feel like outsiders in the United States. Using the 2001 National Jewish Population Survey, we examine the factors that differentiate those who feel like outsiders from those who do not. We find that feeling like an outsider is largely associated with having experienced anti-Semitism, the number of Jews living nearby, the proportion of a respondent's friends' that are Jewish, and whether Jews identify with some branch of Judaism versus those who identify as ethnic Jews. Although the effects of discrimination on feeling like an outsider are unsurprising, the smaller but persistent effect of geographic context deserves more attention. Jews feel less like outsiders when they live in places where they can and do have more contact with other Jews. The increased within-group ties that are possible in areas of greater Jewish concentration appear to facilitate psychological integration into the larger community.  2011 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1280;2012;"A large body of historical evidence describes the use of hallucinogenic compounds, such as psilocybin mushrooms, for religious purposes. But few scientific studies have attempted to measure or characterize hallucinogen-occasioned spiritual experiences. The present study examined the factor structure of the Mystical Experience Questionnaire (MEQ), a self-report measure that has been used to assess the effects of hallucinogens in laboratory studies. Participants (N = 1,602) completed the 43-item MEQ in reference to a mystical or profound experience they had had after ingesting psilocybin. Exploratory factor analysis of the MEQ retained 30 items and revealed a four-factor structure covering the dimensions of classic mystical experience: unity, noetic quality, sacredness (F1); positive mood (F2); transcendence of time/space (F3); and ineffability (F4). MEQ factor scores showed good internal reliability and correlated with the Hood Mysticism Scale, indicating convergent validity. Participants who endorsed having had a mystical experience on psilocybin, compared to those who did not, had significantly higher factor scores, indicating construct validity. The four-factor structure was confirmed in a second sample (N = 440) and demonstrated superior fit compared to alternative models. The results provide initial evidence of the validity, reliability, and factor structure of a 30-item scale for measuring single, hallucinogen-occasioned mystical experiences, which may be a useful tool in the scientific study of mysticism.  2012 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1281;2012;"A number of studies have noted that small religious groups with charismatic leaders seem to have different gender dynamics than do groups without. We argue that the presence of such a leader changes what charisma ""means"" in such a group. Without such a leader, strong personalities may appear charismatic and lead to positions of high status-and such dynamics historically have tended to be associated with a positional advantage to males. With such a leader, however, charisma is more likely to be compatible with receptivity and decoupled from gender characteristics that tend to disadvantage women, leading charismatic women to have greater status than they would otherwise have.  2012 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1282;2012;Although research has found a positive relationship between various forms of adolescent religious involvement and educational outcomes, little research has examined connections to educational attainment. Using a nationally representative sample of youth (the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health-Add Health), we examine the extent to which adolescent religiosity facilitates educational attainment (i.e., high school completion and college enrollment) and whether informal mentorships formed during adolescence with religious and nonreligious adults can help explain the link between adolescent religious involvement and educational attainment. The findings confirm that, like academic outcomes, religious youth are more likely to complete high school and enroll in college even when controlling for other individual and interpersonal factors that affect educational attainment. Furthermore, informal mentorships, particularly those with adults who have official religious positions (e.g., priest, minister, rabbi) play an important role in college enrollment.  2012 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1283;2012;Club good models developed by economists suggest that the club provides a benefit to members by fostering the provision of semi-public goods. In the case of religion, churches create enforcement mechanisms to reduce free riding. Consequently, the psychic costs of deviant activity should be higher for individuals who belong to religious groups with strong social norms. Data from the General Social Survey are used to examine whether the cost of using pornography is greater for the more religiously involved. We measure the cost of using pornography as the happiness gap or the gap between the average happiness reported by individuals who do and individuals who do not report using pornography. The happiness gap is larger for individuals who regularly attend church and who belong to religious groups with strong attitudes against pornography.  2012 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1284;2012;"Comparative rationality analysis formally examines the incommensurable social rationalities that theoretically exist within religions and the social sciences according to the ideological surround model (ISM) of the psychology of religion. This study extended these procedures to a new cultural context: 220 Iranian university students responded to the Religious Problem-Solving Scales developed by Pargament et al. (1988). As hypothesized, the Collaborative Problem-Solving Style was consistent, and the Self-Directing Style inconsistent, with Iranian Muslim religious and psychological adjustment. The Deferring Style had ambiguous implications. Comparative rationality analysis demonstrated that sample interpretations of these styles explained greater variance in adjustment than did the original scales. These procedures also yielded the unexpected discovery that the Deferring Style included a secular as well as a religious form of Iranian rationality. These data most importantly support the ISM claim that ""future objectivity"" requires empirical analyses of the incommensurable rationalities operating within the psychology of religion.  2012 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1285;2012;"Despite a well-documented connection between religion and mortality, the link between religion and obesity-related outcomes and behaviors has not been adequately studied, particularly among adolescents. This study examines whether self-reported religious beliefs influence decisions about physical activity and diet in a sample of Jewish adolescents (n = 351). The results show that reporting a stronger influence of religious beliefs on health behaviors is associated with behaviors related to physical activity, but not diet. In adjusted regression models, individuals who report that their religious beliefs influence decisions about being physically active ""a lot"" have significantly more active days per week than those who say their religious beliefs do not influence such decisions. Similar effects are seen with regard to the students' overall amount of sedentary time. The results shed light on previously documented relationships between religion and health, provide practical implications for religious organizations and leaders, and suggest areas for future research.  2012 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1286;2012;"Due to the unique cultural niche inhabited by ""paranormal"" beliefs and experiences, social scientists have struggled to understand the relationship between religion and the paranormal. Complicating matters is the fact that extant research has primarily focused upon North America, leaving open the possible relationship between these two spheres of the supernatural in less religiously pluralistic contexts. Using data from a random, national survey of Italian citizens, we examine the nature of the relationship between religiosity and paranormal beliefs in a largely Catholic context. We find a curvilinear relationship between religiosity and paranormal beliefs among Italians, with those at the lowest and highest levels of religious participation holding lower average levels of ""paranormal"" belief than those with moderate religious participation. This pattern reflects how two influential social institutions, religion and science, simultaneously define the paranormal as outside of acceptable realms of inquiry and belief.  2012 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1287;2012;Existing religious economy models maintain that as religious regulation increases, levels of interreligious competition decrease. But new understandings of the market dynamics of religious oligopolies necessitate new understandings of religious competitiveness. A relational model of competitiveness using the case of evangelical Christianity in Buddhist-majority Sri Lanka is proposed. In Sri Lanka the informal religious economy is defined by competitiveness among evangelical Christian groups and, although not recognized by the state, is closely regulated. The focus in this article is on the scalar determinations of evangelical competitiveness, patterns of secrecy and subterfuge, the formation of strategic extra-group networks that enable competitiveness, and outcomes of a relational model. Three insights are offered that can be used as a starting point for further work on religious oligopolies, informal economies, and relational understandings of religious competition.  2012 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1288;2012;Historically, religious groups have been absent from the American environmental movement, but since the late 1990s a host of new religious environmental movement organizations (REMOs) have emerged. Little is known about REMOs or how religion structures the nascent movement field. Drawing on interviews with leaders of 63 REMOs in the United States, we examined whether theological frames and religious affiliations, on the one hand, and environmental interests, on the other, shaped the formation of information exchange and joint action between REMOs. The results show that shared religious affiliations and theological frames are directly associated with joint action between REMOs. In contrast, shared environmental interests are associated directly with information exchange, but not joint action. The results suggest that cultural aspects of religion are linked to the structure of the religious environmental movement.  2012 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1289;2012;Important questions remain about religion-based variations in the propensity to trust. A new perspective on the religion-trust nexus is proposed by examining Protestant theological conservatism as a moral framework reflected in personal convictions about scripture (the authoritativeness of the Bible), sin (beliefs in human depravity and the existence of hell), and salvation (the need for a born-again experience to be saved). Findings indicate that personal commitment to this framework is negatively related to the propensity to trust unknown others, net of other religious factors (religious affiliation and involvement). Commitment to this moral framework also suppresses the positive relationship between religious attendance and generalized trust among Christians. The findings highlight a considerable negative relationship between Protestant theological conservatism and generalized trust, while further underscoring the crucial importance of analyzing belief systems, when investigating complex linkages between religious participation, faith, and civic life.  2012 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1290;2012;In 1994, 1 million Rwandans were violently killed in only 100 days. Devastating for some Rwandan survivors was the significant role that some Catholic parishes and leaders took in ignoring, facilitating, and even perpetuating the genocide. This article seeks to understand how Rwandan genocide survivors draw on religion as they negotiate their postgenocide identities in the United States and comprehend their current faiths, beliefs, and practices. Based on qualitative interviews with Rwandan survivors now located within the United States, I argue that the experiences of religiosity postgenocide serve as both an obstacle and a resource in postgenocide life, creating significant individual and local ramifications for community engagement, reconciliation, and trauma recovery.  2012 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1291;2012;"In a youth-oriented evangelical congregation where being perceived as ""old"" might marginalize member involvement and participation, a Hollywood, California congregation's women's ministry, God Chicks, presents aging women as possessing ""godly wisdom,"" endowing older women with spiritually charged energy, authority, and responsibility for training younger women to live ""godly"" lives. Ethnographic research and in depth media analysis of the God Chicks ministry reveals a particularly energizing evangelical postfeminist orientation that applies prosperity theology to contemporary challenges of changing women's roles. Specifically, the God Chicks ministry provides ""women over forty"" with consumer and caretaking strategies for maintaining youthful selves and motivating younger women. A ""God Chick"" emerges as a compelling, youthful gendered religious identity that expects congregationally committed women to be strong, healthy, and active warriors who fight multiple relational and global humanitarian battles. Overall, this study demonstrates the construction of an innovative postfeminist evangelical identity through the tactical, opportunistic use of theological doctrine by ministry leaders within a particularistic geographic location.  2012 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1292;2012;In contrast to typical approaches that view religion as problematic or benign, thicker conceptions of religion's place in promoting and sustaining democratic politics are possible. This includes religious organizations modeling democratic practices and engaging in debate on common terms. We initiate this program of inquiry with data from a survey of Presbyterian Church, USA clergy gathered during the late summer and fall of 2009. We asked explicitly about clergy commitment to democratic norms and practices as reflected in their public speech and small group activities in their congregations. We use this article to explain variance in the results, looking especially to see if democratic commitments fall at the expense of religious competition, organizational maintenance, and personal preference and increased conservatism.  2012 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1293;2012;Many studies have noted significant relationships between religious sentiment and psychological adjustment, but few have been able to comment on the direction of influence. We assessed the relationships between religious values, self-esteem, and trait hope when participants were in grades 11 and 12. The variables showed moderate levels of rank-order stability. Structural equation modeling revealed that religious values in grade 11 did not predict improvements in self-esteem in grade 12, but they did predict improvements in hope. In contrast, hope did not lead to increase in religious values. These results held after controlling for personality (Big Five factors and Eysenck's psychoticism factor). Results are discussed with reference to the beneficial effects of religious values in adolescence.  2012 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1294;2012;Martin Riesebrodt argues that his theory of religion can help explain religion's enduring power in the contemporary globalizing and secularizing world. Although he emphasizes the necessity of objective categories for theorizing religion's purpose, adherents' narratives about their religious practices reveal lived relationships between ideal-typical liturgical texts (which help comprise religion) and their appropriations of them for navigating rapidly changing social contexts (religiousness). The validity of Riesebrodt's approach for explaining religion in empirical settings is demonstrated by using ethnographic interviews of Muslim reformist women in Dakar, Senegal. These female adherents' discourses on the practices of veiling, prayer, and preaching the uniqueness of God highlight the ways religion's directives operate in a dialectical relationship with a religiousness that encompasses their dual efforts to achieve closeness to God and overtly critique other Muslim groups, contemporary urban life, and the state.  2012 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1295;2012;Migrants are selected by several characteristics (age, education, skill, health, and family migration experience). Often less examined is religious selection. Using Guatemalan data, this research note tests whether religious affiliation is significantly associated with migration to the United States, net of other competing factors. Results are robust, demonstrating that Protestants are more likely than other religious groups to migrate. Additionally, mediating factors (social networks, cultural norms, and ideological links) are tested to identify social mechanisms behind the Protestant effect. The research note concludes with implications of religious selection and how religious selection can be further examined in migration and religion studies.  2012 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1296;2012;Modern dispensationalism in the United States has been a thorny sociological problem. The sociodiscursive mechanism(s) by which dispensationalist preachers are able to propagate their message has yet to be determined. The theoretical work of Martin Riesebrodt, specifically his discussion of salvific demand, legitimation, and discursive and behavior-regulating practices, sheds light on Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins's best-selling Left Behind series and the equally popular dispensationalist writings of John Hagee. Dispensationalists create a demand for their message through the interpretation of current events using the apocalyptic lens of the dispensational scenario, which points to the imminence of the rapture and the global doom that will follow. As part of the propagandizing discourse (discursive practices) that promises escape from this cataclysm, dispensationalists preach a set of behavior-regulating practices that seek to constrain and control the actions of their adherents.  2012 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1297;2012;"Mormons, Adventists, and Witnesses have all felt called to take their teachings to the world and have experienced growth. However, they have varied considerably in both their geographic spread-where they have developed a presence over time-and also in where they have been more successful numerically. The result is sharply differing profiles: Adventists are concentrated more in the developing world; Witnesses and Mormons are proportionately stronger in the developed world, but in different parts of it. Within countries, Witnesses and Mormons are more urban, while Adventists are more concentrated in rural regions; Adventists also tend to be poorer than Witnesses and especially practicing Mormons. The article explores why these differing patterns developed, expanding on a recently developed theoretical model by Cragun and Lawson that religious growth depends on the synchronization of supply and demand and their corresponding components.  2012 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1298;2012;Muslims are now the second largest religious group in almost all Western countries and a large majority of Muslim citizens are children who attend schools. However teachers' attitudes regarding the education of Muslim students are largely ignored by educational researchers. In this study, we investigate the determinants of teachers' attitudes among Flemish (Belgian) teachers (N = 620). Regression analysis has revealed that female teachers, Muslim teachers, younger teachers, and teachers with a four-year college degree have significantly more positive attitudes. Most interestingly, we found that teachers working in schools that enroll a larger share of Muslim students (greater than 50 percent) have more negative attitudes toward Muslim students than other teachers. The implications of these findings for educational policy are discussed.  2012 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1299;2012;No single paradigm or debate currently orients the social scientific study of religion. Because of this, those engaged in the multidisciplinary study of religion find that a public conversation is often difficult. In this article and the Forum it introduces, we explore Martin Riesebrodt's recently published book, The Promise of Salvation: A Theory of Religion. Responding to the inadequacies of secularization paradigms, rational choice models, and postmodern criticism, Riesebrodt proposes an approach that ideal-typically reconstructs the subjective meanings of institutionalized religious practices (liturgies). These subjective meanings center on the prevention and management of crises-social, natural, and bodily-through appeal and access to superhuman powers. This pragmatic emphasis on the superhuman defines religion as a distinct sphere of social action transhistorically and transculturally. Riesebrodt's theory creates new analytical possibilities, especially for understanding the modern resurgence of religion under conditions of secularization.  2012 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1300;2012;Parental divorce has been linked to religious outcomes in adulthood. Previous research, however, has not adequately accounted for parental religious characteristics, which may render the association spurious and/or moderate the relationship. Many studies also do not consider subsequent family context, namely, whether one's custodial parent remarries. Using pooled data from three waves of the General Social Survey, we examine the nature of the relationships among parental divorce, subsequent family structure, and religiosity in adulthood. Growing up in a single-parent family-but not a stepparent family-is positively associated with religious disaffiliation and religious switching and negatively associated with regular religious service attendance. Accounting for parental religious characteristics, however, explains sizable proportions of these relationships. In fact, after accounting for parental religious affiliation and service attendance, growing up with a single parent does not have a significant effect on religious service attendance. Parental religiosity also moderates the relationship between growing up with a single parent and religious service attendance: being raised in a single-parent home does have a negative effect on religious service attendance among adults who had two religiously involved parents. There is modest evidence of this moderating relationship for other religious outcomes. Implications of these findings are discussed.  2012 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1301;2012;"Popular beliefs conflating ethnic identities with particular faiths can lead to marginalization of religiously and ethnically ""other"" and fuel ethnoreligious conflict even in secularized societies. Despite their importance to ethnoreligious conflict and coexistence, ideological conflations of faith and ethnos have previously received little scholarly attention. We fill the gap by introducing the concept of ethnodoxy: a collectively held belief system that rigidly links a group's ethnic identity to its dominant faith. We theorize this phenomenon at three levels: macro (the interplay between religion and ethnonational identities), micro (construction of ethnoreligious identities and imagined communities viewed from a social identity theory perspective), and meso (the nature and functions of popular ideologies and religiosities). Subsequently, ethnodoxy is conceptualized as an ideal-typical syndrome of six component beliefs. We further operationalize and verify the concept using representative national survey data from Russia. Findings show ethnodoxy's extent, coherence, dimensionality, and associations with religious and ethnic intolerance.  2012 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1302;2012;Previous research suggests liberal religious advocates often find it necessary to use broadly accessible technical or moral language to communicate with policymakers and public audiences, yet this conformity to secular speech norms diminishes the distinctiveness of their religious voices. Communicating through storytelling offers them one way of overcoming this dilemma. This is demonstrated by examining liberal religious advocacy during recent healthcare reform debates in the United States, using data from interviews and public communications by advocates. By embedding stories within religiopolitical performances that highlight their religious identities, advocates convey policy-relevant information without relying on explicitly religious language that may be inaccessible or unpersuasive to diverse audiences. They also deploy storytelling strategically, bearing witness to injustices experienced firsthand, secondhand, from the pews, and from the past, depending on the context. These findings have implications for ongoing debates about religious citizens' capacity to communicate across lines of difference in the public sphere.  2012 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1303;2012;"Previous studies of religion on civic and political participation focus primarily on Western Christian societies. Studies of Muslim societies concentrate on Islamic religiosity's effect on attitudes toward democracy, not on how Muslim religious participation carries over into social and political arenas. This article examines the relationship between religion and civic engagement in nine Muslim-majority countries using data from the World Values Surveys. I find that active participation in Muslim organizations is associated with greater civic engagement, while religious service attendance is not. In a subset of countries, daily prayer is associated with less civic engagement. The main area in which Muslim societies differ from Western ones is in the lack of association between civic engagement, trust, and tolerance. Religious participation is a more significant predictor of secular engagement than commonly used ""social capital"" measures, suggesting a need to adapt measures of religiosity to account for differences in religious expression across non-Christian faiths.  2012 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1304;2012;"Recent work has demonstrated that Canadians overreport church attendance at rates similar to respondents in the United States. Overreporting in the United States has been attributed to the importance of religious identity; causes of Canadian overreporting have not been examined. This article draws upon Stryker's identity theory to explain why Canadian survey respondents overreport church attendance. The 2005 Canadian General Social Survey contains observed measures of attendance from both a conventional survey question and a time diary, allowing a direct and rigorous test of the identity explanation. Findings suggest that rates of Canadian overreporting, at about 50 percent, rival rates of overreporting in the United States. Moreover, like overreporting in the United States, Canadian overreporting may be affected by an identity process during the survey interview. Finally, implications for measuring religiosity in both countries are discussed.  2012 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1305;2012;Research finds that religious youth, compared to less religious youth, are more likely to delay their sexual debut (sometimes until marriage). This study is one of the first to examine the influence of involvement in religion-supported secular activities for shaping initiation into vaginal sex. Does involvement in religion-sponsored secular programs produce any health-related benefits for youth? Using two waves of data from the National Study of Youth and Religion this study finds that among teens who have engaged in some of the precursors to first sex, namely, sexual touching, involvement in religion-sponsored secular activities is associated with lower odds of having first sex between W1 and W2. Conservative attitudes about sex outside of marriage explain, in part, the relationship. Conversely, network overlap, the number of friends who belong to a youth group, and pressure from friends and partners to have sex do not significantly mediate the relationship.  2012 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1306;2012;Research has demonstrated that white conservative Protestants are more opposed to abortion than their Catholic counterparts. At the same time, conservative Protestantism has made significant inroads among U.S. Latinos. This study augments existing research on religion and racial-ethnic variations in abortion attitudes by comparing levels of support for legalized abortion among Catholic and conservative Protestant Latinos. Data are drawn from a nationally representative sample of U.S. Latinos. Significantly greater opposition to abortion is found among religiously devout conservative Protestant Latinos when compared with their Catholic counterparts. Latino Catholicism, which functions as a near-monopolistic, highly institutionalized faith tradition among Hispanics, produces weaker antiabortion attitudes than those exhibited in Latino conservative Protestantism. Among Latinos, conservative Protestantism operates as a niche voluntaristic faith. These factors produce a religious schema that yields robust antiabortion attitudes. This study has important implications for understanding the intersection of race-ethnicity, religion, and public policy preferences.  2012 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1307;2012;Researchers have developed scales to measure religious coping among Christians, Jews, Muslims, and Hindus. However, there is no quantitative measure of religious coping for Buddhists. The present study describes the development and initial validation of a scale of Buddhist coping (BCOPE). Eight hundred sixty participants in the United States completed the BCOPE along with demographic information and scales of adjustment to stress. Construct validity of the BCOPE is demonstrated through exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, which reveals 14 types of Buddhist coping. BCOPE subscales exhibited criterion validity through significant correlations with outcome measures. The BCOPE has incremental validity, predicting adjustment over and above demographic and global religious measures. The research and practical implications of the BCOPE are discussed.  2012 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1308;2012;"Several hypotheses regarding the relationship between religiosity and deviance are examined using data from the geocoded General Social Survey. An inverse relationship between religiosity and several forms of deviance was documented; however the moral community hypothesis, which would predict that the interaction between group-level religiosity and individual-level religiosity would be inversely related to deviance, was not supported for any of the forms of deviant behavior examined. Additionally, the antiasceticism hypothesis, which argues that religiosity is more effective at deterring minor rather than serious forms of deviance, is only partially supported by the results of the analysis. The theoretical implications of this line of research, as well as suggestions for future avenues of research, are also discussed.  2012 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1309;2012;Since the September 11 terrorist attacks, hate crimes against Arabs have increased in the United States. Despite recent increases in anti-Arab attitudes, little psychological research has been conducted to understand this prejudice. Across two studies, we tested a theoretical model of Arab and African-American prejudice. We found the aggression facet of right-wing authoritarianism mediated the relationship between religious fundamentalism (RF) and prejudice toward Arabs and African Americans. Results are interpreted in light of previous research on cognitive rigidity, RF, and prejudice, and implications are made for political leaders conversing about Arab nations and peoples.  2012 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1310;2012;"Social actors use prayer utterances (e.g., statements such as ""prayed over,""""prayed about,"" or ""spent time in prayer"") as aligning actions that justify problematic or questionable courses of action and prevent possible negative characterizations. The prayer utterance functions as an aligning action in American society because of Americans' beliefs and actions concerning the efficacy of prayer in solving problems and because prayer is viewed as a sign of personal morality and trustworthiness. Three examples of individuals who use the prayer utterance as an aligning action serve as illustrations of this argument (Oprah Winfrey, Alabama State Supreme Court Justice Sue Bell Cobb, and President Barack Obama). Scholars should investigate the uses and functions of prayer utterances in social life and should also investigate the possible uses of other religious talk as aligning actions.  2012 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1311;2012;"The ""prosperity gospel"" is an understudied feature of the religious landscape of the United States. Little is known about the social patterning of prosperity gospel beliefs. We focus on two core dimensions of socioeconomic status (SES)-education and income-as potential influences. Our analyses of data from the Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life's 2006 Survey of Pentecostals produce three findings. First, education and income have negative and mostly independent associations with prosperity gospel beliefs. Second, SES-based patterns remain after accounting for other attributes of the religious role. Third, while most education-based differences are contingent upon the attributes of the religious role, these contingencies are not replicated for income-based differences. These observations reinforce the long-standing claim that SES plays a pivotal-and complex-role in the social patterning of religious beliefs.  2012 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1312;2012;"The ascetic ideals initially established by Confucius are moderate and rational. Yet, virtuoso asceticism became a social phenomenon when the state desired to institute a more powerful channel to disseminate Confucian values in the broader populace beyond the literati. The reason that the cult of the virtuoso particularly served this purpose was that the enshrinement of virtuoso generated social power within community. That social power, somewhat equivalent to charisma, derived from the enshrined spirit's connection with transcendence having official and public offerings from community. The social process in the formation of the ascetic virtuoso and its social function in the Confucian tradition follow a pattern similar to that laid out by Martin Riesebrodt: denial of the physical self, restructuring of social relations, and spiritual transformation. Ascetic virtuosos stemming from the tradition of ""inner-worldly"" asceticism closed a gap between a rationalized system of behavior-regulating practices and interventionist practice with reference to transcendence.  2012 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1313;2012;The collapse of the Soviet Union ended a long period of state repression of religion, facilitating a possible religious revival in Russia. Despite evidence of increasing levels of Russian Orthodox identification in the 1990s, however, the debate over whether post-Soviet Russia is an exception to secularization trends elsewhere continues. We address this debate by examining trends in Orthodox identification and church attendance and their impact on conservative moral values, as well as the basis of religiosity in age cohorts, using a seven-wave national, stratified random sample survey covering 1993-2007. The analysis indicates continued growth in Orthodox self-identification, increased church attendance, and an increasingly strong association between religiosity and conservative morality over this time period. Moreover, signs of religious revival are most pronounced among the cohort of people who came to maturity after communism ended. The resurgence of Orthodoxy in Russia provides a robust exception to secularization trends in Western Europe.  2012 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1314;2012;The relative size of religious groups or denominations within societies or nations influences variation in the extent to which group members psychologically identify with their religion. National-level census data measuring the proportional size of religious groups in New Zealand are merged with nationally representative data on self-reported psychological identification drawn from the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study. A multilevel random coefficient model shows a logarithmic function for the relationship between religious group size and average group-level religious identification. Members of smaller religious groups (less than 1.5 percent of the population) tend to strongly identify with their religion, whereas members of groups that are larger in size (over 6 percent of the population) tend to be less identified, on average. Religious group cohesion may be a dynamic process. Larger religious groups are less cohesive and experience more contested identities and ideological positions (average group identification is lower).  2012 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1315;2012;The religious composition of the Chinese Diaspora varies by countries with the highest Christian share in the Philippines (86 percent) and the highest Buddhist share (84.3 percent) in Cambodia. The religiously unaffiliated are more likely found in Vietnam (74.7 percent), Canada (70.1 percent), and Austria (63 percent) and less likely found in the Philippines (0.6 percent) and Malaysia (1.5 percent). A further analysis of high-quality Canadian census data allows for a more in-depth focus. In 2001, 81 percent of the 125,000 Chinese migrants (those born in mainland China who had moved to Canada between 1996 and 2001) were unaffiliated, 11 percent were Christian, and 7 percent Buddhist. Relative to the topic of conversion, data on Chinese migrants admitted to Canada between 1981 and 1990 reveals growth in the proportion that self-identified as religiously affiliated (Christian as well as Buddhist) and a decline in the proportion who reported no religion.  2012 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1316;2012;The religious economies model has been influential in the sociology of religion. Yet, propositions drawn from the model have been difficult to test in the comparative and historical study of religion, generally for lack of appropriate data. We develop a general theory of religious disestablishment and apply it to the Reformation in 16th-century Europe to explain variation in the abolition of the Catholic monopoly. We suggest three principal factors-changes in demand, entry control mechanisms, and political incentives-that explain why incumbent religious firms may lose their monopoly. We then analyze the resulting hypotheses in a systematic analysis of cities in the Holy Roman Empire. Our analysis yields mixed support for demand-side factors and entry control mechanisms, and firm support for political incentives in the institution of reform.  2012 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1317;2012;The revival of folk (popular) religion in China in the last three decades has been noted in many publications and documented in ethnographic studies. However, until now there has been no quantitative study that provides an overall picture of Chinese folk-religion practices. This article is a first attempt to draw the contours of Chinese folk religion based on three recent surveys conducted in mainland China and Taiwan. Three types of folk religion are conceptualized: communal, sectarian, and individual. Different types of folk religion may have different social functions and divergent trajectories of change in the modernization process. At present, in spite of the dramatic social, political, and cultural changes in modern times, the adherents of folk religion still substantially outnumber the believers of institutional religions in Chinese societies.  2012 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1318;2012;"The term ""postsecular"" is proliferating in the writings of scholars working in the humanities and social sciences. This article assesses the variety of meanings attributed to the term, groups them in six clusters of ideas, and raises questions about the tensions that exist between some of its different meanings. Taking the central idea that religions enjoy relatively high visibility in the public sphere of postsecular societies, the article then considers how well this applies to the case of Britain. It argues that the visibility of religion in Britain's public sphere-far from being postsecular in any of the current meanings of the term-is actually associated with the state's ""interpellation"" of selected religions as partners in the delivery of public policies for managing diversity, combating inequality, and promoting social enterprise.  2012 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1319;2012;This article analyzes social norms regulating the selection of godparents in Italy and France. Based on Vatican statistics and European Values Study responses, the vast majority of children in Catholic Europe are baptized and birth rituals are considered important even by nonbelievers. Moreover, the dominant custom of selecting godparents from among kinsmen is a recent development, based on historical data. A new survey about the selection of godparents in Italy and France, conducted for this study, shows that godparents are chosen not for religious, but for social-relational reasons. Selection of kinsmen is the norm, with uncles and aunts being the majority choice. For Italy, choice determinants are explored by means of multinomial regressions. The results are contrasted with demographic change to show that in lowest-low fertility countries current godparenthood models are bound to disappear.  2012 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1320;2012;This article argues that zero-sum, forced-choice approaches to measuring religious belief do not work well outside of the Abrahamic world. Positive-sum approaches to measuring religious beliefs (in the plural) are better suited to the study of polytheistic societies. Using results from a nationally representative survey conducted in 2011 Taiwan, we demonstrate that in a polytheistic society like Taiwan, religious belief is not zero sum. We also contrast our results with those of the Taiwan Social Change Survey (TSCS), and seek to show that our positive-sum approach to measuring religious beliefs can help us better understand the disparate causes and consequences of different religious beliefs in polytheistic societies. The challenge of Christocentrism in quantitative studies of religion is also discussed.  2012 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1321;2012;This article considers how well Martin Riesebrodt's practice-centered theory of religion addresses religious change among Catholics in eastern Africa. Two arguments are advanced using a generational change scheme. First, Riesebrodt's focus on religious practices assists in understanding many changes that African Catholics and their communities have experienced over time. It acknowledges believers' perspectives and the impact of missionaries, and it generates comparative insights across different cases. However, Riesebrodt's approach has limitations when developing a comparative perspective on historical transformation in these communities. Therefore, his focus on the objective meaning of interventionist religious practices needs supplementing: (1) capturing religious change within a given religion requires attention both to practices and their subjective appropriation by believers, and (2) in the forging of collective identities, theological reflection by elites helped connect Catholic practices to preexisting worldviews and Catholic practices marked generational change by distinguishing Catholics from other African Christians.  2012 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1322;2012;"This article examines whether shared religious beliefs and religious social relationships (Durkheim) and belief in a personal, moral God (Stark) negatively affect attitudes toward the acceptability of white-collar crime. In addition, using a large cross-national sample and estimating multilevel models, we test whether effects are conditional on modernization and religious contexts characterized by belief in an impersonal or amoral God. Shared religious beliefs and the importance of God in one's life are negatively related to the acceptability of white-collar crime. These effects, however, weaken in religious contexts characterized by belief in an impersonal or amoral God as do the effects of religious social relationships and belonging to a religious organization; modernization, on the other hand, does not have a moderating effect. In short, religious belief is associated with lower acceptance of white-collar crime and certain types of religious contexts condition this relationship.  2012 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1323;2012;"This article uses and develops Martin Riesebrodt's distinction between religion and religious tradition to shed light on the making of various articulations of religious identities and political projects. Based on extensive research on the Polish and Qubcois cases, I show how social and state actors in these societies reactivate past religious traditions to respond to current social transformations and articulate societal projects and advance political agendas in the present. In both cases, religion and religious tradition are juxtaposed to articulate new national identities or fortify older ones, and to respond more specifically to the challenges posed by ""pluralism."" I suggest that sociologists who work at the intersection of religion and politics can contribute to our understanding of the various registers through which religion, religious action, and religious tradition are rendered meaningful to social actors, used for different goals (religious and not) and transformed in the process.  2012 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1324;2012;This research note focuses on Muslim minorities living in a secular context, the Netherlands. The question is whether mosque attendance among Turkish- and Moroccan-Dutch changed between 1998 and 2006, testing mechanisms of religious decline and religious vitality. Elaborating on previous research of the same Muslim groups, this study examines a longer time span and adds contextual-level explanations. Whereas previous research reported a linear trend towards secularization over time and over generations, in recent years the trend has become more complex. The revival of religious attendance among the second generation is most striking. Forces of secularization such as educational attainment and generational replacement gradually lose their predictive power. Over time, processes of secularization are therefore not inevitable.  2012 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1325;2012;Traditional beliefs play an important role in many Sub-Saharan African village societies. These beliefs imply immediate punishment for any breach of the moral code, and the possibility to influence an individual's life by the use of magic. We analyze the economic impact of traditional beliefs on behavior by conducting an experiment with microentrepreneurs in the environs of Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso). The salience of traditional beliefs is randomly varied through semistructured interviews. We find that priming traditional beliefs substantially increases prosocial behavior in the Trust Game. This effect is independent of age, gender, religious affiliation, or wealth.  2012 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1326;2012;"Using data from the 2007 Pew Religious Landscape survey (PRLS), which includes over 650 Buddhist respondents (after weighting), this research note examines the usefulness of previously devised typologies for describing the religious and social characteristics of Buddhists in the United States. Existing ""two Buddhisms"" typologies capture the category breaks of the U.S. Buddhist landscape, with a couple of exceptions: convert Buddhists report higher rates of belief and higher rates of social activity than do those born into the religion. Analysis also shows that three-group typologics capture additional complexity within the U.S. Buddhist landscape. Examination of the social characteristics of Buddhists in the United States mostly corroborates previous assumptions with one exception, women do not outnumber men.  2012 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1327;2012;Using data from the first wave of the Portraits of American Life Study (PALS), we consider the extent to which people report that religious factors influence their decisions about career choice, marriage, residency, and number of children. We find significant positive relationships between the importance of religion or religious faith and the perceived influence of religious factors on one's choice of occupation, decision about whether or whom to marry, decision about where to live, and decision about how many children to have. We also observe significant interactions between the importance of religion or religious faith and religious tradition, but we find no consistent patterns across our decision-making outcomes. Our preliminary conclusions raise significant questions about the broader relationship between religion, perception, and decision making.  2012 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1328;2012;Youth in the United States are experiencing increasing numbers of family transitions as parents move in and out of marriages and cohabiting relationships. Using three waves of survey data from the National Study of Youth and Religion, I examine the relationship between family structure, parental breakup, and adolescent religiosity. A person-centered measure of the religiosity of adolescents is used to identify youth as Abiders, Adapters, Assenters, Avoiders, or Atheists and to assess movement of youth between the religious profiles between 2003 and 2008. Wave 1 family structure is not significantly related to religious change among adolescents at Wave 3. In contrast, the experience of a parental breakup is related to a change in religious profiles over time. Parental breakup is associated with religious decline among Abiders and Adapters, youth characterized by high levels of religious salience. However, among Assenters who are marginally tied to religion, a parental breakup or divorce is associated with increased religious engagement.  2012 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1329;2013;"""Spirituality"" often has been framed in social science research as an alternative to organized ""religion,"" implicitly or explicitly extending theoretical arguments about the privatization of religion. This article uses in-depth qualitative data from a religiously diverse U.S. sample to argue that this either/or distinction not only fails to capture the empirical reality of American religion, it does no justice to the complexity of spirituality. An inductive discursive analysis reveals four primary cultural ""packages,"" or ways in which people construct the meaning of spirituality in conversation: a Theistic Package tying spirituality to personal deities, an Extra-Theistic Package locating spirituality in various naturalistic forms of transcendence, an Ethical Spirituality focusing on everyday compassion, and a contested Belief and Belonging Spirituality tied to cultural notions of religiosity. Spirituality, then, is neither a diffuse individualized phenomenon nor a single cultural alternative to ""religion."" Analysis of the contested evaluations of Belief and Belonging Spirituality allows a window on the ""moral boundary work"" being done through identifying as ""spiritual but not religious."" The empirical boundary between spirituality and religion is far more orous than is the moral and political one.  2013 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1330;2013;A negative association between religiosity and crime is commonly documented in the United States and other Western contexts. In this study, we examine associations between religiosity and criminal probability among randomly selected survey respondents in a non-Western Christian context (Lviv, Ukraine) and a non-Western Islamic context (Dhaka, Bangladesh). In addition, we explore whether religiosity is associated in these contexts with various theoretical mechanisms identified in prior research, including self-control, social control, moral beliefs, negative emotions, and social support. Results confirm that religiosity is negatively correlated with projected criminal probability in non-Western contexts as well as among both Christian and Muslim respondents. Furthermore, net of social and demographic characteristics, religiosity appears to indirectly influence crime through moral beliefs and, to a lesser extent, through self-control and informal social control.  2013 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1331;2013;"American civil religion (ACR) burst on to the scholarly scene in 1967, and has been periodically revived as a source of analytic insight and normative hope since that time. It posited a universalist, prophetic, nonsectarian faith, referenced on the nation, that served as both a source of unity for the American people and a discursive resource for political leaders and protest movements. Using recent political events as illustrative cases, I argue that ACR is not only a universalist, prophetic creed, it is also an expression of tribal identity that ascribes a particular character and purpose to the American people. In particular, this ""tribal"" civil religion has an often-unstated assumption about the inseparability of religion, race, and national identity-that is, white, Christian, and American. Recent events have disrupted those implicit connections, leading to a vociferous reemphasis of their centrality to the national story. I maintain that neither ACR, nor recent politics involving immigration and Barack Obama's presidency, can be understood fully without considering the religion-race-national identity nexus.  2013 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1332;2013;Are people more prosocial in a religious context? We addressed this question through an experiment. We randomly placed participants in the control group in a neutral location (a lecture hall), and we placed participants in the experimental group in a religious location (a chapel). The participants then took part in a one-shot three-person public goods game, which measured participants' degree of cooperativeness. The results showed that participants in the experimental group cooperated significantly more than did participants in the control group. Furthermore, participants' beliefs about other participants' cooperativeness were more positive in the experimental group than they were in the control group. Improved expectations of others partially explained the enhanced cooperation in the religious context. We found no main or interaction effect of self-reported religiosity in the experiment.  2013 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1333;2013;As a medicalized condition, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) sparks considerable public controversy. Previous research has highlighted the importance of examining the factors that influence attitudes toward ADHD. This article examines an understudied factor, religion, and its relationship with ADHD attitudes. Using data from the 2002 General Social Survey National Stigma Study-Children, this research finds that compared to the rest of the population, evangelical Christians are less likely to view ADHD as a real disease and to believe children with ADHD should be treated with medication. Results also demonstrate that evangelicals are more likely to think doctors are overmedicating children with common behavior problems and to think medication prevents families from working out problems themselves. On the other hand, church attendance is unrelated to beliefs about ADHD treatment but is positively associated with thinking ADHD is a real disease. These findings add new insights to the existing literature on religion and medicalization.  2013 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1334;2013;Based on 45 in-depth interviews, textual analysis, and participant observation with seven different atheist organizations, this article investigates the collective identity work of atheists in the United States. It explores the social psychological and interactional dynamics of atheist organizations as well as how they contribute to the construction and maintenance of atheist identities. I discuss the various strategies atheists employ as they collectively manage a stigmatized identity and negotiate the meaning of their atheism with one another and with the nonatheist public. This is accomplished in part through an analysis of the identity politics and minority discourse contemporary atheists currently engage. In addition, and more broadly, this study explores the relationship between collective identity and social action through an analysis and description of contemporary atheist activism.  2013 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1335;2013;Based on content analysis of the popular evangelical magazine Christianity Today, I show that while evangelicals' outward opposition to pornography has remained steady and robust across the period 1956 to 2010, nonetheless, during this same time, evangelicals' anti-pornography narratives have become increasingly secular. Through using and expanding Chaves's notion of internal secularization, I demonstrate how these narratives have become decreasingly legitimated through religious forms of moral authority such as scriptural prohibitions and derivative ideas about God's plan for society, and increasingly legitimated through secular forms of moral authority such as humanistic conceptions of individual rights and of psychological health. I refer to this type of internal secularization as the process of outsourcing moral authority, and I discuss the theoretical significance of this process for potential investigations of a range of other moral narratives.  2013 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1336;2013;"Between 1982 and 2011, four Israeli governmental reports addressing ostensible dangers from ""cults"" (new religious movements, or NRMs) were issued. The 1980s reports use a collectivist discourse, in which the state sees itself as defending the collective's borders from external threats and representing various sectors while seeking consensual values. The 1990s report marks an interim stage in which the state tries to balance individual liberties with sectoral interests. The 2011 report focuses solely on harm to individuals and is the harshest of the four. The reports reflect milestones in three processes of change that have taken place in Israeli society: from a collectivist-hegemonic ethos to a multisectoral one; from a focus upon society to a focus on the individual; and from nationalistic values to universalistic ones. At every point in time, NRMs represented a different perceived threat to Israeli society. We explain how multisectoralism brings about both tolerance toward new religious phenomena and fierce anti-cultic activity.  2013 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1337;2013;"Building upon Acker's ( Hierarchies, jobs, bodies: A theory of gendered organizations. Gender and Society 4(2):139-58; 2006. Inequality regimes: Gender, class, and race in organizations. Gender and Society 20(4):441-64) theory of gendered organizations and inequality regimes, this study investigates the extent to which inequality in gender and sexuality are linked within religious congregations. Using a nationally representative sample of congregations in the United States, the results demonstrate that a congregation's stance toward allowing women to serve as head clergyperson is significantly associated with its acceptance of gays and lesbians as members or leaders within the congregation. This research extends existing literature in three ways. First, it offers support for the utility of the concept of inequality regimes for investigating dimensions of inequality in addition to gender. Second, it provides evidence of the intersection of gender and sexuality within religious congregations, thereby contributing to the growing dialogue on congregational responses to homosexuality. Finally, these findings propose a number of avenues for future research regarding gender, sexuality, and organizations.  2013 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1338;2013;"Challenging the contemporary belief that emotional damage invariably results from new religious movement (NRM) participation, this study shows that membership in and exit from a world-rejecting NRM may initiate the development of increased reflexivity and a personal sense of self for some former members. Out of a sample of 23 former members, 12 participants were identified who report prior histories of ""other-directedness"" and for whom exit from an NRM instigated a shift toward increased independence and individuality. Employing symbolic interactionist theories of self, this article conceptualizes the process through which these participants may be understood to have gained in reflexivity and personal autonomy. Four case studies demonstrate how the identity loss and uncertainty suffered following exit can ""shock"" former members into self-awareness and reflexivity, instigating a period of active learning about personal emotions, thoughts, and beliefs that leads to the active construction of a stronger personal self.  2013 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1339;2013;Changes in leadership can be difficult for any organization. Leadership transitions in religious congregations might be especially challenging given the personal relationships involved and the spiritual dimension of a leader's position. This complexity often makes it difficult to separate the reasons for the transition from the impacts of the transition. For example, loss of membership and congregational conflict can be both a cause and a consequence of leadership change. Using the 2006-2007 National Congregations Study, this research explores how membership decline and congregational conflict are associated with leadership transitions in religious congregations. Although we find that leadership transitions are associated with conflict and membership decline, we also find that certain factors, such as whether the leader comes from within the congregation and context of the transition, moderate these associations.  2013 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1340;2013;Chaplains in healthcare increasingly work in interfaith roles with patients and families from a range of religious and spiritual backgrounds. Some move with ease between their own religious backgrounds and those of the individuals with whom they work. Others encounter tensions as their status as a person of faith comes into conflict with their status as an interfaith chaplain. We explore the two main strategies-neutralizing and code-switching-chaplains at one large academic medical center use when working with patients and families whose religious and spiritual backgrounds are different from their own. Through training in clinical pastoral education and experiences on the job, chaplains learn to neutralize (use a broad language of spirituality that emphasizes commonalities rather than differences) and to code-switch (use the languages, rituals, and practices of the people with whom they work). To the extent that the strategies evident here are present among chaplains in a broader range of institutional settings, they suggest a kind of spiritual secularism or broad approach to meaning makings that may be facilitated by interfaith chaplains in a range of settings.  2013 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1341;2013;Debates about whether the relationship between religiousness and depression is nonlinear have continued, but no definitive conclusions thus far have been drawn. Unlike most previous research in this area, which has been based on U.S. populations, this study focuses on a sample of 882 young rural Chinese women. Results from analyses reveal an inverse U-shaped relationship between intrinsic religiosity and depression. In addition, results show that intrinsic religiosity and religious activities exacerbate the deleterious effects of particular life events such as childbirth issues and marital conflicts. Implications of the findings for future studies on the subject are discussed.  2013 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1342;2013;Due to conservative Protestant elites challenging scientists in the public sphere, and prominent scientists attacking religion, scholars have claimed that there is an increasing conflict between conservative Protestants and science. However, these claims have never been empirically investigated and these general claims do not specify what conflict is actually about. In this article I use the General Social Survey from 1984 to 2010 to examine whether conservative Protestants are increasingly opposed to the social and moral influence of scientists. I find evidence for increasing opposition by biblical literalist conservative Protestants to the involvement of scientists in social debates about moral issues.  2013 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1343;2013;Emerging adulthood is a period when religious beliefs are likely to be shaped. Studying the influence of religious culture on prosocial behavior among emerging adults aids our understanding of the process and effects of religious socialization. Mormon religious culture places a particularly strong emphasis on caring for family and fellow Mormons. Because intrinsically religious individuals internalize their religious community's values, we hypothesized that the relationship between intrinsic religiosity and volunteering would be stronger among Mormons than among Catholics or non-Catholic Christians. We tested this hypothesis using a sample of Mormon (N = 118), Catholic (N = 304), and non-Catholic Christian (N = 542) emerging adults (18-29 year olds) across three volunteering contexts (religious, family, and secular). Controlling for extrinsic religiosity and worship attendance, the relationship between intrinsic religiosity and frequency of volunteering was greater among Mormons than Catholics and non-Catholic Christians in the context of religious and family volunteering. However, intrinsic religiosity was not a significant predictor of secular volunteering. Our findings suggest that Mormon culture influences the frequency and type of volunteering engaged in by young Mormon adults.  2013 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1344;2013;"Empirical studies of religion's role in society, especially those focused on individuals and analyzing survey data, conceptualize and measure religiosity as ranging from low to high on a single measure or a summary index of multiple measures. Other concepts, such as ""lived religion,"" ""believing without belonging,"" or ""fuzzy fidelity"" emphasize what scholars have noted for decades: humans are rarely consistently low, medium, or high across dimensions of religiosity including institutional involvement, private practice, salience, or belief. A method with great promise for identifying population patterns in how individuals combine types and levels of belief, practice, and personal religious salience is latent class analysis. In this article, we use data from the first wave of the National Study of Youth and Religion's telephone survey to discuss how to select indicators of religiosity in an informed manner, as well as the implications of the number and types of indicators used for model fit. We identify five latent classes of religiosity among adolescents in the United States and their sociodemographic correlates. Our findings highlight the value of a person-centered approach to understanding how religion is lived by American adolescents.  2013 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1345;2013;"I conduct the first large-N study explicitly exploring the association between belief in God and sense of purpose in life. This relationship, while often discussed informally, has received little empirical attention. Here, I use the General Social Survey to investigate how form of and confidence in belief in God is related to sense of purpose in life, as measured by a Likert item level of agreement with the statement ""In my opinion, life does not serve any purpose."" Using logistic regression analysis, I find that those who indicate that they are confident in God's existence report a higher sense of purpose compared to nonbelievers, believers in a higher power, and those who believe but occasionally doubt.  2013 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1346;2013;In this article we analyze the role of religion in the composition of Americans' networks of anticipated emotional support. Drawing on data from the National Survey of Religion and Family Life, which contains information on multiple sources of potential emotional support, we use latent class analysis to uncover four different anticipated support profiles, which are organized along two dimensions of variation: religiosity and breadth. We label these profiles religious, secular, broad, and limited. Our analyses demonstrate associations between these anticipated support profiles and a person's gender, family status, age, race, socioeconomic status, and religious involvement. For instance, we find that Catholics are more likely than non-Catholics to have secular rather than religious support profiles, and African Americans tend to have profiles that are either religious or limited. Finally, we show that these profiles have implications for well-being. We contribute to research on religion and emotional support by describing how religious and secular sources combine into overall anticipated support profiles. Our conclusion addresses the implications of these findings for current scholarship on religion and emotional support networks.  2013 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1347;2013;In this article, we propose a new approach to an old question: How does development affect religion-state relations? We argue that because development increases states' ability to effectively formulate and implement policy, it will be associated with greater state regulation of religion. This stands in contrast to predominant theories that examine development's negative impact on individual religiosity while largely overlooking the impact that development may have on state institutions. We test our theory using data drawn from over 160 countries, and demonstrate that the effect of economic development on state regulation of religion is consistently positive, substantively significant, and robust to alternative measurements and the inclusion of a broad range of controls. Statistical analysis also demonstrates that the correlation between development and state regulation of religion is primarily a result of economic development's impact on state capacity, rather than social dislocation or improved coordination by religious communities. Incorporating state capacity recasts the study of religious regulation-and suggests that economic growth is unlikely to take religion off the political agenda.  2013 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1348;2013;"In this article, we shed light on the volunteering behaviors of Latter-Day Saints (Mormons). While some information was known about this group and its volunteering practices, detailed and reliable data were not available. This is the first study by a secular research institution to be given permission by the church to collect data within Latter-Day Saint congregations. We found a high rate of volunteering by almost all members, which was mostly, but not only, for religious purposes. About half the volunteering comes from fulfilling ""callings,"" while members initiate the other half. We found variations in volunteering based on the studied regions, age, income, education, gender, and generational membership. These findings provide the first reliable and detailed information regarding Latter-Day Saint volunteering and may serve as a springboard for future research on the pro-social behaviors of various religious groups.  2013 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1349;2013;"Individual religiosity relates to prosocial attitudes, behavioral intentions, and behaviors of minimal (no/low cost; limited to in-group members) prosociality in hypothetical situations. Yet evidence on religious prosociality through other-oriented, costly helping behavior in real life is still to be documented. Similarly, religiosity relates to cognitive, emotional, and attitudinal components of prejudice toward moral out-groups. Evidence on real behavior of prejudice is nevertheless still needed. In two experiments using the same measure of religiosity and samples from the same population, religiosity predicted helping, in a real-life context, of an in-group member in need (Experiment 1) as well as overt and direct aggression by means of allocating hot sauce to a gay, but not to a neutral, target (Experiment 2). Religious prosociality and aggression are real, concern distinct kinds of targets, and are at the heart of personal religiosity.  2013 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1350;2013;Managing existential concerns is theorized to be a key function of religion. We posit that priming religion should be related to greater existential security for those high in intrinsic religiosity. In Experiment 1, priming religion increased intercultural tolerance among individuals who were highly intrinsically religious but decreased it for those low in intrinsic religiousness. In Experiment 2, intrinsic religiousness again moderated the effects of the prime, suggesting that priming religion resulted in attenuated afterlife anxiety for intrinsically religious individuals but greater anxiety for individuals low in intrinsic religiousness. Religious reminders appeared to provide existential security-evidenced by tolerance and reduced death anxiety-only to those high in intrinsic religiousness and can be threatening to those low in intrinsic religiousness. Existential outcomes are a specific case in which intrinsic religiousness can moderate the effects of religious primes, suggesting that religion plays a different existential role for different people.  2013 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1351;2013;Many Americans believe God answers prayers, but scholars know little about how individuals handle situations in which they perceive that prayers have gone unanswered. Using data from an in-depth interview project with current and former victims of intimate partner violence, I argue that perceived unanswered prayers cause challenges to belief systems that elicit attribution processes-or cognitive processes through which individuals try to explain the causes of actors' behavior-whose outcomes are explanations for why God did not answer their prayers. I find that the outcomes of these attribution processes are God-serving justifications, or attributions of God's perceived unanticipated or problematic behavior that define this behavior as appropriate to the situation. God-serving justifications for unanswered prayers fall into three types: (1) appeal to higher loyalties, (2) affirmation of benefits, and (3) denial of the pray-er. I conclude with a discussion of the implications and limitations of the analysis.  2013 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1352;2013;"New spirituality has often been accused of being egocentric and thus lacking incentives for social engagement. The discussion on this subject is tangled because authors differ in specifying who they are writing about and what the criticism is. After seeking an adequate demarcation of the target group (people involved in new spirituality), we established a concept of social engagement that distinguishes between behavior that is and that is not driven by egocentric motivation. Using measures based on this conceptual model, we surveyed a representative sample of the Dutch population. We found that on most measures people involved in new spirituality are less socially engaged than affiliated or traditionally religious people but more engaged than ""secular"" people. However, they are more committed to organizations for environmental protection, peace, or animal rights than others. Overall, demographic factors-especially education, age, and gender-are stronger predictors for social engagement than religious and spiritual beliefs, experiences, or practices. The most important spirituality variable that predicts some social engagement measures is connectedness with self, others, and nature.  2013 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1353;2013;Prayer is often an interpersonal phenomenon. It represents not only a form of social support shared between or among people, but also a means of embedding an unobservable actor (God) within a conventionally observable social network. This study considers whether the receipt of intercessory prayer from close network ties is associated with future-oriented well-being. Analyses use social network module data from the Portraits of American Life Study (PALS), a nationally representative study of American adults containing a breadth of information not available in prior studies of networks, prayer, and well-being. Despite experiencing more instances of recent adversity (mental or physical health problem, financial trouble, and unemployment), prayed-for PALS respondents report the highest levels of optimism. Furthermore, the association between network prayer and optimism is robust to inclusion of individual-level indicators of religiosity. Finally, other forms of social support that an individual receives from his or her close ties do not explain the benefits of intercessory prayer.  2013 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1354;2013;Prayer is the most common form of religious practice and a central part of religious experience, yet little is known about whether individuals' prayer activities and beliefs tend to remain stable or develop over the life course. This study examines change during the course of older adulthood in a range of dimensions of prayer, including total frequency of private prayer, specific beliefs and expectancies regarding prayer, and the contents of prayers. Data come from four waves of an ongoing longitudinal survey of Christian older adults, covering a period of seven years. Growth curve analysis was used to model patterns of within-person change in these factors. Linear increase was observed in total prayer frequency and in beliefs about prayer emphasizing placing trust in God over expecting immediate rewards. Frequency of prayer increased for all types of prayer contents, including prayers for others, for God's will, in thanksgiving, for guidance, for health, and for material goods. Only the belief that one's prayers are answered remained stable during the course of the study. Results highlight the dynamic nature of prayer beliefs and behaviors in late life, and partially support a pattern of growing faith maturity.  2013 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1355;2013;Previous studies examining the relationship between religion and providing social support have claimed that religious involvement and social networks explain the higher levels of social support among religious Americans. By limiting its focus to attenders of religious congregations, this study seeks to understand if private devotional activities and congregational context also matter for predicting the provision of social support in a highly religious sample. Utilizing a sample of attenders and their congregations from the 2008/2009 U.S. Congregational Life Survey, a national survey representative of American congregations, this study uses multilevel models to examine the relationships that congregational involvement, private devotional activities, and congregational context have with providing social support. Results suggest that, among attenders of religious congregations, congregational involvement and private devotional activities matter for predicting the provision of social support, but two aspects of congregational context-size and theology-do not.  2013 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1356;2013;Previous studies have not longitudinally assessed whether religion is related to individuals' movement into volunteering activities across the adult life course. Using four waves of panel data, I present evidence that religion is associated with individuals' movement into religious institution and nonreligious institutional forms of volunteerism-volunteering for a religious congregation or other religious organization, and volunteering for a nonreligious institution, respectively. I consider the general religious mechanisms of changes in motivation to volunteer through enhanced religious beliefs and increased opportunities to volunteer through greater religious service attendance and involvement. Increased religious belief and attendance result in a greater probability that individuals engage in religious institution volunteerism. Religious institution volunteering increases the likelihood of movement into other formal volunteering over the adult life course. This analysis offers evidence that religious institutions are feeder systems, as increased involvement yields more opportunities for formal volunteerism over the adult life course, irrespective of underlying personality traits. Additionally, the findings suggest that religious mechanisms may operate differently across Christian religious traditions.  2013 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1357;2013;"Public acceptance of evolution remains low in the United States relative to other Western countries. Although advocates for the scientific community often highlight the need for improved education to change public opinion, analyses of data from a national sample of American adults indicate that the effects of educational attainment on attitudes toward evolution and creationism are uneven and contingent upon religious identity. Consequently, higher education will only shift public attitudes toward evolution and away from support for teaching creationism in public schools for those who take non-""literalist"" interpretive stances on the Bible, or to the extent that it leads to fewer people with literalist religious identities.  2013 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1358;2013;Rejection of Darwinian evolution (implying rejection of the common origin of all species, including humans) was assessed among 1,100 churchgoers from a range of Christian denominations in England. The main predictors of rejecting evolution were denominational affiliation and attendance. Individuals from Pentecostal or evangelical denominations were twice as likely to reject evolution compared with those from Anglican or Methodist churches. In all denominations, higher attendance was associated with greater rejection of evolution. Education in general, and theological education in particular, had some effect on reducing rejection, but this was not dependent on having specifically scientific or biological educational qualifications. Psychological type preferences for sensing over intuition and for thinking over feeling also predicted greater rejection, after allowing for the association of type preferences and general religiosity. Reasons for the association between psychological type and rejection of evolution are discussed in the light of the known characteristics of different function preferences.  2013 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1359;2013;Religious factors have been shown to influence whites' attitudes toward interracial marriage, but this relationship has yet to be studied in depth. This study examines how religious affiliation, beliefs, practices, and congregational composition affect whites' attitudes toward interracial marriage with African Americans, Asians, and Latinos. Employing data from Wave 2 of the Baylor Religion Survey, I estimate ordered logit regression models to examine the influence of religious factors on whites' attitudes toward racial exogamy, net of sociodemographic controls. Analyses reveal that, relative to evangelicals, religiously unaffiliated whites report greater support of intermarriage with all minority groups. Biblical literalists are less likely to support interracial marriage to Asians and Latinos. However, whites who frequently engage in devotional religious practices are more likely to support interracial marriage with all racial groups, as are whites who attend multiracial congregations. My findings suggest that the relationship between religion and whites' attitudes toward racial exogamy is more complex than previously thought and that the influence of religious practices and congregational composition should not be overlooked.  2013 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1360;2013;Research on civic engagement shows that volunteering rates decline as young people move from adolescence into emerging adulthood. Using panel data spanning this period of the life course, we examine the impact of secondary schooling type-public, Catholic, Protestant, private nonreligious, and homeschool-on sustaining volunteering into emerging adulthood. We apply a framework that posits pathways between secondary schooling and sets of opportunities to volunteer embedded in institutions and social networks. We also posit a link between schooling type and durable motivational dispositions to volunteer. Results indicate substantial differences by schooling type, although our measures of opportunity structure and motivation do not adequately account for these differences. Those educated in Protestant secondary schools are considerably more likely than other young people to continue to volunteer, even accounting for potential spurious influences. Those schooled at home or in private nonreligious settings are significantly less likely to continue volunteering. We conclude by discussing two alternative accounts that should be addressed in further research: one focused on the role of habituated social practices and the other focused on differences in organizational efforts to link adolescent volunteering to emerging adult volunteering.  2013 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1361;2013;"Researchers often expose participants to a series of words (e.g., religion, God, faith) to activate religious concepts and observe their subsequent effects on people's thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. This research has revealed many important effects of experimentally manipulated religious cognition in domains ranging from prosocial behavior to prejudice. However, it is not exactly clear what constitutes a ""religious cognition,"" and no research has yet investigated conceptual distinctions between different kinds of religious prime words. In the present research we used a card-sorting task to examine laypeople's subjective understanding of religious prime words, and the central categories or dimensions of these religious concepts. Using multidimensional scaling, property fitting, and cluster analysis methods to analyze the proximities among the words, we find evidence for the mental representation of three relatively distinct kinds of religious concepts: agents (e.g., God, angel), spiritual/abstract (e.g., faith, belief), and institutional/concrete (e.g., shrine, scripture). Theoretical and methodological impli-cations for religious priming research are discussed.  2013 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1362;2013;"Scholarly and public discourses on Muslim immigrants in Europe have questioned if Islam is an impediment to sociocultural adaptation and whether Muslims are a distinctive group in their religiosity and social values. We use a new survey of 480 British Muslims in conjunction with the British Social Attitudes Survey to examine differences between Muslim and non-Muslim Britons on religiosity (practice, belief, salience) and moral and social issues regarding gender, abortion, and homosexuality. Muslims are more religious than other Britons, including both British Christians and religious ""nones."" Muslims also are more conservative than other Britons across the range of social and moral attitudes. Multivariate analysis shows, however, that much of the difference on moral issues is due to socioeconomic disadvantage and high religiosity among Muslims. Although being a highly religious group in an otherwise secular country renders Muslims distinctive, factors that predict social conservatism among all Britons-high religiosity and low SES-apply similarly to Muslims.  2013 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1363;2013;"Scholars have long argued that the reduced mortality risk associated with frequent participation in religious services derives from two sources: social participation and religious belief efficacy. In contrast, the reduced mortality risk associated with participation in nonreligious groups is thought to derive solely from the social participation component. This study tests the religious efficacy hypothesis by comparing the effects of religious participation with nonreligious participation using meta-analyses of 312 mortality risk estimates from 74 publications (providing data on more than 300,000 persons). We found no significant difference between the mean hazard ratio (HR) for low religious participation (HR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.24-1.41) and the mean HR for low nonreligious participation (HR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.17-1.33). These findings suggest that the positive health effects of religious participation may largely be attributed to the social participation component, rather than to the religious component of the act.  2013 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1364;2013;Scholars have long observed that religion and forgiveness are generally positively linked, but it is unclear why this is the case. This article proposes and tests potential mechanisms by which religion promotes forgiveness. Using data from the 1998 General Social Survey, I find that holding a collaborative orientation toward God, subscribing to a pervasive role of religion, and believing God forgives are primary factors promoting one's propensity to forgive both oneself and others. These factors have varying influence on interpersonal forgiveness compared to self-forgiveness and further illuminate the differences between the two processes. My findings demonstrate the importance of analyzing a person's religious beliefs and orientations directly, in addition to examining other dimensions of religion, such as affiliation, frequency of religious activity, and official religious teachings.  2013 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1365;2013;Significant effort has gone into understanding and promoting racial diversity in congregations. Still, uniting worshippers of different races remains a challenging endeavor. Even congregations that successfully attract worshippers of different races often have difficulty sustaining their multiracial composition. This study contributes to the discussion of race and religion by examining racial group differences in belonging and participation in congregations. Drawing on organizational ecology theory, we develop four hypotheses to test whether and how racial group size corresponds to congregational commitment. Results of multilevel modeling using 2001 U.S. Congregational Life Survey data reveal that those who are a part of a congregation's largest racial group possess a stronger sense of belonging and participate at a deeper level than congregants of other races. Moreover, differences in belonging and participation by racial group persist regardless of group size.  2013 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1366;2013;"Stillbirth and neonatal death often trigger immense and long-lasting grief in parents. These life-altering losses both call upon and call into question parents' religious beliefs and practices. This qualitative research examines the impact of stillbirth and neonatal death on parental religiosity, broadly conceived to include personal spirituality and any religious affiliation, including atheism. It examines religion online, a nontraditional but important social context for grief, especially regarding statistically rare tragedies such as stillbirth and neonatal death. Content analysis of postings on a hub website for ""babyloss"" parents yields four major themes: religious disorientation, religious reorientation, changed relationships with others, and a quest for meaning.  2013 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1367;2013;The entrepreneur is a celebrated figure in American society. These innovative risk-takers hold an influential place in the economy and in popular culture. Substantial research has gone into identifying characteristics associated with these individuals, but research on entrepreneurs and religion is surprisingly sparse and inconsistent. Using national survey data, we examine religious affiliation, belief, and behavior for Americans who have started or are trying to start a business. American entrepreneurs appear no different than nonentrepreneurs in religious affiliation, belief in God, or religious service attendance. They do tend to see God as more personal, pray more frequently, and are more likely to attend a place of worship that encourages business activity. A discussion of implications concludes the research note.  2013 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1368;2013;The relationship between religion and violence is controversial. Discrepant findings exist between survey studies and the limited number of experimental investigations of religiosity's influence on aggressive behavior. We have attempted to resolve this discrepancy by addressing previous limitations in the literature and assessing a heretofore-untested moderator of religiosity and aggression: alcohol intoxication. This investigation included a community sample of 251 men and 269 women randomly assigned to either an acute alcohol intoxication condition or a placebo condition. Participants completed a series of questions drawn from standardized instruments of religiosity and spirituality prior to competing on an aggression laboratory paradigm in which electric shocks were received from, and administered to, a fictitious opponent under the guise of a competitive reaction-time task. Hierarchical regression analyses revealed a significant beverage-by-religiosity interaction. Religiosity predicted lower levels of aggression for participants in the placebo group and higher levels of aggression for intoxicated participants. Results indicated that high religiosity coupled with alcohol intoxication may be a risk factor for aggression. This novel finding may help to clarify previous discrepancies in studies of religiosity and aggression.  2013 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1369;2013;"This research note contributes to an evaluation of the validity of secularization theory by studying the relationship between economic modernization and patterns of religious change. Both the disenchantment narrative of Berger and Weber and the existential security perspective of Inglehart hypothesize that economic development should be accompanied by a weakening of religious values. Using macro-level panel regressions, my analysis reveals that while economic growth is directly associated with diminishing church attendance rates, it is not directly associated with a decline in belief. The relation between economic growth and religious decline is therefore not primarily mediated by a ""secularization of consciousness."" Findings instead indicate that economic prosperity leads to a change in consumption patterns on the part of individuals due to increased income and availability of alternative, secular opportunities to meet needs previously fulfilled by traditional religion. A decline in religious belief may occur as a secondary consequence of this behavioral change, since diminishing worship attendance rates reduce the influence of religion on value socialization.  2013 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1370;2013;"This study compares the estimates of religious composition of counties in the United States from three independent datasets: the 2010 Religious Congregational Membership Study (RCMS); the 2010 Infogroup Congregational membership data (INFO); and the Gallup Daily Poll-a large national survey with more than 1.3 million respondents. My analyses suggest that the estimates for most major religious groups from the three datasets are highly correlated to each other. In addition, the measures of local religious compositions from the three datasets successfully predict the religious composition of friendship networks in a large, nationally representative survey. These findings suggest that RCMS, the most widely used data source for measuring local religious composition in the United States, has a convergent and predictive validity. My analyses, however, also highlight important challenges in measuring geographic distributions of non-Christian populations, as well as total religious populations in all religious traditions.  2013 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1371;2013;This study examines the extent to which Muslim self-identification and mosque attendance have changed in the period 1997-2009 among people of Turkish and Moroccan descent in the Netherlands. Mainly trendless fluctuations are found. Overall, Muslim self-identification seems to very slightly increase and mosque attendance seems to very slightly decrease. We examined the extent to which factors that are important according to theories and previous research explain or enlarge these differences over time. The factors about which we hypothesize are largely unable to explain differences over time in Muslim self-identification and mosque attendance.  2013 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1372;2013;This study examines the relationship between social capital inequality, race, and personal fundraising within evangelical outreach ministries (EOMs). Drawing on quantitative and qualitative data that assess the personal fundraising experiences and outcomes of a large sample of EOM workers (N = 715), I demonstrate that the fundraising challenges and deficits faced by EOM workers are best understood as deficits in the social capital of these individual workers. Multivariate analyses affirm that social capital deficits (that is, having smaller social networks and networks with fewer resources) negatively affect the fundraising experiences and outcomes of EOM workers, especially for racial minorities. Findings also evidence a strong correlation between the paucity of minority EOM workers' social capital and the extent to which they must seek bridging social capital from white individuals and churches. This study concludes with implications for the financing of American evangelical parachurch organizations, the sustained racial and socioeconomic homogeneity of EOMs, and theories of social capital exchanges within interracial religious organizations.  2013 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1373;2013;"This study examines whether individuals in a network esteem peers who think in integratively complex ways about religious issues in the context of a small-group educational course comprised of young British Muslims. Integrative complexity (IC) measures the degree to which an individual's information processing is characterized by (a) rigid, black-and-white thinking or (b) ability to recognize the validity of, and integrate, multiple perspectives. A novel measurement procedure was developed for this research called the Social Field Generator. Results from seven groups (n = 55) showed that (a) participants with levels of IC were described by their peers with more positive sentiment than their low-IC counterparts; (b) the higher the IC scores of participants, the closer peers felt toward them; and (c) the highest IC individuals were consistently selected as sources of advice, whereas the lowest IC individuals were not viewed as sources of advice. This research shows that within an educational environment aimed at promoting complex thinking, group processes and grassroots religious leadership can encourage higher levels of IC as a group norm.  2013 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1374;2013;This study investigated a conceptual model with two pathways, altruism and perceived spiritual support, leading to resilience among student volunteers following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita (H-KR). Both strengths share the sense of deep connections. Parallel pathways with the two major constructs were estimated using structural equation modeling, adjusting for demographics and peritraumatic emotional reactions. The two indicators may have served as a protective mechanism for all volunteers despite differing racial/cultural backgrounds. The potential protection of these strength factors was mediated through optimism and hope. Resilience among minority volunteers was associated more with faith-related strengths, as indicated in the relevant pathway that also contributed to their altruistic actions. The resilience of white volunteers, however, was directly associated with altruism, a strength that does depend heavily on religious beliefs. Further, the modification index suggested a direct path from race to depression.  2013 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1375;2013;While evangelicals have been popularly portrayed as caring primarily about social issues including abortion and homosexuality, there have been more reports in recent years of evangelical leaders, congregations, and institutions shifting focus to environmental issues. Are evangelicals shifting attention to and becoming more progressive in their views on the environment? Moreover, are evangelicals fracturing over the issue of environmentalism, as some have suggested? Using content analysis of three evangelical periodicals (Christianity Today, Sojourners, and World) from 1984 to 2010, I find not only that attention to environmental issues has increased over time, but also that the discussion has grown increasingly polarized and politicized. This change represents a potentially important break with the Republican Party and the Christian Right, as moderate evangelicals have moved to the left on environmental issues. Even among highly religious, self-identified evangelical political elites, there is more diversity in views and political leanings than is commonly assumed. I conclude with a discussion of the implications of a lack of alignment between evangelical elites, traditional Christian Right leaders, and the Republican Party.  2013 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1376;2014;A growing body of literature indicates a modestly positive association between religiosity and spirituality as predictors of psychological health (anxiety and depression), suggesting they serve as personal resiliency factors. The purpose of this study was to expand our understanding of the relationships among these constructs. Using Lazarus's Transactional Model of Stress as a theoretical framework, we examined: (a) the extent to which spirituality and religiosity mediated and/or moderated the association between perceived stress and psychological health and (b) whether there was a moderated (religiosity) mediation (spirituality) between stress and health. The Perceived Stress Scale, Daily Spiritual Experiences Scale, Religious Commitment Inventory, and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale were administered to measure the following constructs: stress, spirituality, religiosity, and psychological health. This study utilized a nonexperimental, quantitative, correlational, cross-sectional, moderated-mediation design, and included a convenience sample of 331 research participants. Both spirituality and religiosity moderated stress and health. However, only spirituality partially mediated the relationship. In addition, religiosity did not moderate the mediating effects of spirituality. Overall, this study confirmed the role of both religiosity and spirituality as effective resiliency resources.  2014 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1377;2014;Based on qualitative, multisited research, this article examines the impacts of short- and long-term international migration to the Middle East and the West on the Mar Thoma Syrian Christian demonination of Kerala. Migrants and their foreign-born children have new demands and expectations, and significant financial contributions have led to adjustments in the orientation and functioning of the denomination and its clergy. Large-scale emigration has also had indirect effects. International networks and the economic affluence of the population, along with a rise in social problems caused by migration and consumerism, have led to the rise of evangelical and charismatic transdenominational churches in Kerala that challenge the functioning of established Christian denominations such as the Mar Thoma. Church leaders have been trying to bring about changes to address these developments, but are constrained by the tradition, structure, and the mission of the churches. I draw on theories of organizational religious change and theories of transnationalism to explain the process of social change in Kerala, also addressing some limitations of these theories.  2014 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1378;2014;"Church attendance is usually measured in surveys by asking a direct question about frequency of churchgoing over a preset period of time, which is typically a year. Different studies have cast doubt over the validity of this indicator as it tends to overestimate actual attendance to a significant degree. The aim of this article is to compare data on church attendance provided by two different types of research conducted in the United States between 1975 and 2010: survey data (GSS) and data obtained from time use surveys (ATUS). This comparison has three main objectives: (1) to confirm the hypothesis that survey data tend to overestimate actual attendance; (2) to show that this overestimation is not constant over time and space, but tends to vary in an erratic and unpredictable way; and (3) to demonstrate that data provided by time use surveys are more reliable than the frequencies of churchgoing provided by traditional surveys when the objective is to identify trends in religiosity in a population.  2014 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1379;2014;"Despite the influence of social support on physical and mental health, few studies have examined why some close ties are more supportive than others. Though religion provides a rich context for social interaction and a meaningful social identity, it has received little attention in the social support literature. A growing literature on religion and health offers insight into how religion affects social support processes. Using dyadic network data derived from the nationally representative 2006 Portraits of American Life Study, I examine how the religious dimensions of close, nonhousehold ties relate to provision of social support. Results from logistic regression analyses indicate that (controlling for a range of other social tie characteristics) same-faith ties are significantly more likely to be sources of help ""in times of need,"" while religious discussion is a strong predictor of receiving both help and advice. The effect of religious homophily is strongest for evangelical Protestants and African-American Protestants. My findings underscore the need for social support researchers to consider the role of religion in shaping support processes in close relationships.  2014 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1380;2014;Developing survey measures of religion is deceptively difficult. As religion in America becomes more diverse and research projects become more global, finding a shared vocabulary that taps into concepts of interest and selecting response categories that capture the full range of choices becomes ever more challenging. This research project introduces new tools and techniques for exploring and evaluating past survey measures of religion, including a new software tool that draws on the ARDA's massive collection of survey measures. We offer two examples to demonstrate how these resources can serve to evaluate past survey measures of religion and improve future measures.  2014 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1381;2014;Early marriage has important consequences for individuals in the United States. Several studies have linked religion to early marriage but have not examined this relationship in depth. Using data from Waves 1, 3, and 4 of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, I conduct multilevel event-history analysis to examine how religion, at both individual and contextual levels, is associated with early marriage. Further, I test mediators of the religion-early marriage relationship. I find significant variation in early marriage by religious tradition, religious service attendance, religious salience, belief in scriptural inerrancy, and religious context in high school. The individual religious effects-but not the school context effects-are explained in part by differential attitudes toward marriage and cohabitation.  2014 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1382;2014;"Following a previous investigation of religio-spiritual beliefs in American Indians, this article examined prevalence and correlates of religio-spiritual participation in two tribes in the Southwest and Northern Plains (N = 3,084). Analysis suggested a ""religious profile"" characterized by strong participation across three traditions: aboriginal, Christian, and Native American Church. However, sociodemographic variables that have reliably predicted participation in the general American population, notably gender and age, frequently failed to achieve significance in multivariate analyses for each tradition. Religio-spiritual participation was strongly and significantly related to belief salience for all traditions. Findings suggest that correlates of religious participation may be unique among American Indians, consistent with their distinctive religious profile. Results promise to inform researchers' efforts to understand and theorize about religio-spiritual behavior. They also provide tribal communities with practical information that might assist them in harnessing social networks to confront collective challenges through community-based participatory research collaborations.  2014 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1383;2014;Given the attention that has been paid to the presence of women in leadership positions throughout the economy and society as well as the role that associations play in shaping citizen political participation, it is surprising that their confluence has not been systematically studied. What effect does men's versus women's associational leadership have on the political engagement of women and men members? Using a set of surveys drawn from Protestant denominations that ordain women as part of the 2001 U.S. Congregational Life Study, I investigate clergy gender effects on church leadership and political participation conditional on member gender using hierarchical models. Across four denominations, I find descriptive evidence but little systematic evidence supporting an effect due to clergy gender, though somewhat more evidence on church leadership than on political activity.  2014 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1384;2014;In a time of increasing religious diversity, interfaith political coalitions have become important settings for interreligious interaction, but little research has explored the types of religious expression that are generated therein. Prevailing theories in the sociology of religion indicate that interaction with religious others results in dilution of traditional religious commitments or production of stronger boundaries. But emerging perspectives in cultural sociology shift attention from individual religious commitments to the ways in which settings shape different styles of religious expression. Insights about edge spaces drawn from urban theory suggest that religiously diverse settings can be generative of new types of religious practices. We apply these insights to the study of interfaith activism by drawing on interviews and ethnographic fieldwork with religious advocacy professionals and activists working in interfaith coalitions. Conceptualizing the sites of these interfaith encounters as edge spaces, we analyze variation in the types of religious expression that occur in interfaith settings. We find that both aggregative and integrative practices are produced, but these vary depending on the goals and structure of the setting, as well as participants' accountability to outside religious gatekeepers.  2014 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1385;2014;In spite of its different cantonal jurisdictions and traditions, the development of religious education in Switzerland over the past decade has taken a common direction: the state has assumed a more active role in the field of religious education in public (state-run) schools. In this article, we ask the question: How do key social actors interpret these reforms and how do these interpretations relate to the social structure of religion in Switzerland, in particular with respect to the majority category of the so-called distanced Christians? Drawing on qualitative interviews with members of the schools' teaching staff, school administrators, and church representatives, the article highlights a dominant interpretative pattern that frames the socially accepted representation of religion in public schools. Thus, rather than addressing the pedagogical dimension of religious education, we discuss the significance of this pattern for the debate on the public presence of religion in Switzerland and Europe.  2014 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1386;2014;"In the ritual theories of Durkheim and Collins, collective effervescence is the engine that drives social solidarity. I use data from religious organizations to perform a rare test of this hypothesis. In addition, four other hypotheses from Collins's interaction ritual theory are tested regarding ritual dynamics that are expected to promote effervescence and solidarity. Congregational data from the 2001 United States Congregational Life Survey reveal the following: (1) organizational attendance rates strongly correlate with the dependent variables; (2) longer rituals tend to be more emotionally rewarding, although there appear to be diminishing returns for symbolic solidarity; (3) crowded rituals are more rewarding, although socioeconomic status is a crucial intervening variable; (4) barriers to outsiders in the form of behavioral proscriptions correlate with symbolic solidarity; and (5) most important, there is a consistent and robust relationship between effervescence and solidarity. Interaction ritual theory provides a valuable framework for understanding how some religious organizations become more effective than others at providing emotional and symbolic rewards for their members.  2014 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1387;2014;"In the United States, white evangelicals are more economically conservative than other Americans. It is commonly assumed that white evangelicals oppose redistributive social policies because of their individualistic theology. Yet Canadian evangelicals are just as supportive of redistributive social policy as other Canadians, even though they share the same tools of conservative Protestant theology. To solve this puzzle, I use multi-sited ethnography to compare how two evangelical congregations in the United States and Canada talked about poverty and the role of government. In both countries, evangelicals made sense of their religious responsibilities to ""the poor"" by reference to national identity. Evangelicals used their theological tools differently in the United States and Canada because different visions of national solidarity served as cultural anchors for religious discourse about poverty. To understand the political and civic effects of religion, scholars need to consider the varied ways that religious groups imagine national community within religious practice.  2014 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1388;2014;Influential political theorists suggest that religious differences in political life may be overcome through shared commitment to political processes. In this article, I subject the underlying assumptions of this proposition to empirical inquiry. When faced with substantive conflict over policy outcomes, do religious persons defer to a political process for resolution? And if so, to which political process do they defer? Through a novel interview exercise with 61 respondents from a variety of religious backgrounds, I find a general willingness to defer to a legitimate political process, even if it results in an undesirable outcome that violates religious (or other) political preferences. However, I also find that a political process need not be democratic to be seen as legitimate, and that process preferences do not map onto religious differences.  2014 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1389;2014;Large segments of the American public are skeptical of human evolution. Surveys consistently find that sizable minorities of the population, frequently near half, deny that an evolutionary process describes how human life developed. Using data from the National Study of Youth and Religion, I examine the role of religion and education in predicting who changes their beliefs about evolution between late adolescence and early emerging adulthood. I conclude that religion is far more important than educational attainment in predicting changing beliefs about evolution. Perhaps more importantly, I find that social networks play an important moderating role in this process. High personal religiousness is only associated with the maintenance of creationist beliefs over time when the respondent is embedded in a social network of co-religionists. This finding suggests that researchers should pay far more attention to the social context of belief formation and change.  2014 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1390;2014;"Political commentators tend to assume that Americans who share a particular religious affiliation think similarly about values issues and that values questions are aligned. Although religious affiliation is a strong predictor of attitudes toward abortion and gay rights, there is differentiation within denominational subgroups with respect to both; for example, while majorities of mainline Protestants and Catholics favor gay marriage, many of their respective co-religionists do not. Further, aggregate survey data shows asynchrony in within-group attitudes on abortion and gay rights; for example, whereas Hispanic Catholics are more likely to support gay marriage than legal abortion, black Protestants are more likely to support legal abortion than gay marriage. Abortion and gay equality are discrete issues and give rise to divergent attitudes based on the lived reality of different ethnoreligious groups. These findings challenge the utility of the construct of the ""values voter,"" and underscore that abortion and gay rights should be recognized as separate public policy domains.  2014 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1391;2014;"Prior research demonstrates that religion and gender traditionalism are associated with less favorable attitudes toward same-sex unions because of its deviation from customary religious doctrine and traditional patterns of gender behavior. This study examines the link between religion, gender traditionalism, and attitudes toward same-sex unions by utilizing a novel measure of gender traditionalism that is distinctly religious as well. Recent work on images of God reveals that individuals' views of the divine provide a glimpse of their underlying view of reality. The results suggest that individuals who view God as a ""he"" are much less favorable toward same-sex unions than those who do not view God as masculine, even while controlling for gender traditionalist beliefs and other images of God. Individuals who view God as masculine are signaling a belief in an underlying gendered reality that influences their perceptions of the proper ordering of that reality, which extends to marriage patterns. These findings encourage future research to identify innovative measures of religion that incorporate aspects of other social institutions to account for their interconnected nature.  2014 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1392;2014;Promises of religious freedoms have become the standard in national constitutions. Yet, despite these assurances, religious freedoms are routinely denied. Combining new data collections with expanded theoretical explanations, this research explores how dimensions of governance and measures of the religious economy contribute to government restrictions on religion. Consistent with recent work on the judicialization of politics, we find that the absence of an independent judiciary is an important predictor of government restrictions on religious freedoms, whereas free elections and government effectiveness are insignificant in our full models. Consistent with the religious economy theory, we find that social restrictions and government favoritism toward a religion(s) are persistent predictors of the government's restrictions. Although the proportion of the population Muslim holds a strong bivariate association with government restrictions (r = 57), the relationship is reduced to insignificance in our full models. We briefly discuss the implications of these findings.  2014 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1393;2014;Religious socialization occurs within the immediate family as well as in the broader social context. Previous research has shown that parents' religiosity matters less for the transmission of religious beliefs in devout than in secular nations, implying smaller costs of religious socialization. In this article we test which other societal factors affect the transmission of religious beliefs: anti-religious policies in formerly socialist countries, economic development, and income inequality. Our results indicate that societies with high levels of income inequality seem to provide the most favorable context for religious socialization. Individuals develop strong religious beliefs even if they only received little religious socialization within the family. Formerly socialist nations increased socialization costs through the overall suppression of religious practice. Economic development has no impact on socialization effects, suggesting that inequality is a more important driver of religious change than previously thought.  2014 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1394;2014;"Research on religious attributions has been limited by a preoccupation with disentangling ""religious"" from ""naturalistic"" attributions and a failure to capture the attributions that people make in response to meaningful events. Thirty years of research has shown that even under optimum conditions religious attributions are rare compared to naturalistic ones. This research draws on unique archival materials comprising letters written to the Panacea Society containing self-reported effects of a spiritual healing treatment based on water-taking practices. This analysis examined attributions over time among a sample of letter writers (N = 19) from the 1920s using the Leeds Attributional Coding System to examine patterns of attributions that correspondents made in response to improvement and worsening of health outcomes. In line with previous research, religious attributions were more common for positive outcomes than negative outcomes. Contrary to previous research, religious attributions accounted for the majority of attributions made compared with nonreligious attributions. We discuss the implications for future research in studying attributions in real-life meaningful settings and in expanding the repertoire of attributions to include religious ritual and community.  2014 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1395;2014;Rumors that President Barack Obama is a Muslim were rampant during the 2008 presidential campaign and continued well into his presidency. These rumors were widely believed, were electorally consequential, and are part of a growing trend of politically motivated misconceptions. Thus, relying principally on the theory of motivated reasoning, we examine the factors that shaped citizens' beliefs about and responses to messages about Obama's faith. Using an original survey experiment and data from the 2008-2009 American National Election Study panel, we show that citizens' responses to rumors about Obama's religion were shaped by political predispositions, political awareness, and their interactions. Identification of Obama with Islam was most widespread, and the cues encouraging such identification were most successful, among individuals with low levels of political awareness, conservative and Republican identifications, and negative views of cultural out-groups. Viewing Obama as Muslim was significantly less prevalent among people with high levels of awareness and with the opposite set of predispositions.  2014 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1396;2014;"Since Peter Berger's (1967, The Sacred Canopy: Elements of a Sociological Theory of Religion, Garden City, NY: Doublday) early work on the sacred canopy, scholars have debated the effects of increased diversity on religious belief and vitality. Smith (1998, American Evangelicalism: Embattled and Thriving, Chicago: University of Chicago Press), in particular, has suggested that subcultures like American evangelicalism can thrive in a religiously pluralistic environment by both engaging with the world while remaining symbolically distinct from it. This article builds on this work as well as recent scholarship on boundary permeability by exploring the mechanisms by which American evangelicals negotiate their boundaries as they adapt to their surroundings. Based on a qualitative content analysis of 109 articles from two evangelical missionary periodicals published over a period of over 20 years, I examine the use of both boundary-strengthening and boundary-weakening processes employed by evangelical missionaries and missiologists (or ""boundary agents""). I find that almost every instance of boundary weakening is also accompanied by boundary strengthening, suggesting that symbolic boundaries are becoming selectively permeable through a process I identify as ""symbolic filtering."" In conclusion, the article briefly considers the implications of these findings for the broader discussion of symbolic boundaries and religious pluralism.  2014 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1397;2014;"Some environmental and religious scholars, religious leaders, and media figures have claimed there has been a ""greening of Christianity"" in the United States since the mid-1990s. Such a trend would be socially significant, as the integration of Christian values and environmental values may invigorate both domains. Using nationally representative data from the 1993 and 2010 General Social Surveys, we analyze how green self-identified Christians in the U.S. general public are in their pro-environmental attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors. Using structural equation modeling, we find no clear evidence of a greening of Christianity among rank-and-file Christians in the general public between 1993 and 2010. Indeed, the patterns of our results are quite similar to those from earlier decades, which documented that self-identified Christians reported lower levels of environmental concern than did non-Christians and nonreligious individuals. We did find evidence of some greening among evangelical Protestants, especially relative to mainline Protestants, between 1993 and 2010. We close by suggesting a few fruitful avenues for further research in this area via variable-oriented, case-oriented, and experimental studies and discussing some theoretical implications of our findings.  2014 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1398;2014;Studies show that different dimensions of religiosity change throughout the life course. Yet, we have little information about how spirituality that some people experience outside of formal religious organizations may change. The purpose of this study is to examine how spirituality associated with artistic leisure may emerge or decline over time. Drawing from two waves of semistructured qualitative interviews conducted five years apart, I examine how the spirituality dancers associate with belly dance changes over time and factors associated with those transformations. Rather than emerging, findings show that whether dancers instill belly dance with spirituality remains stable or decreases. Furthermore, much of the decrease in the spiritual meaning that dancers link to belly dance can be understood in the context of their changing involvement in the dance, different meanings they attach to belly dance, revisiting their personal beliefs about spirituality, and expanding their spiritual outlets.  2014 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1399;2014;Suicide has remained a persistent social phenomenon and now accounts for more deaths than motor vehicle accidents. There has been much debate, however, over which religious constructs might best explain the variation in suicide rates. Our empirical analysis reveals that even though theological and social differences between Catholicism and Protestantism have decreased, Catholics are still less likely than Protestants to commit or accept suicide. This difference holds even after we control for such confounding factors as social and religious networks. In addition, although religious networks do mitigate suicides among Protestants, the influence of church attendance is more dominant among Catholics. Our analysis also indicates that alternative concepts such as religious commitment and religiosity strongly reduce suicide acceptance.  2014 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1400;2014;The construct of quest as measured by the Quest Scale raises complexities that this study addressed with online surveys measuring religiosity, ego identity, and well-being of graduates from two Christian colleges. Intrinsic questers (those above the scale midpoint in intrinsic and quest scores but below the extrinsic midpoint) made up over half of those high in intrinsic religiosity and did not differ in Christian orthodoxy, religious identity, religious coping, or well-being from the pure intrinsics (those high in intrinsic religiosity). Indiscriminately pro-religious questing individuals (those high in intrinsic and extrinsic religiosity and quest) were less religious and showed poorer coping than intrinsic questers. Quest appears to be a reasonable measure of religious orientation, improving prediction of Christian orthodoxy, religious identity, and religious coping, and was more highly correlated with ego identity exploration than with stress. In association with intrinsic religiosity quest does not appear to indicate weak religiosity or poor well-being. Instead, intrinsic questers may pursue a distinctive developmental trajectory, a path of existential searching by which emerging adults manage the demands of contemporary culture while maintaining a mature faith.  2014 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1401;2014;The emergent church movement has fashioned itself as an alternative for Christians who do not want to walk away from their faith, but feel uncomfortable with the dogmatic conservatism found in mainstream evangelicalism. The emerging church movement has portrayed itself as diverse and inclusive, which is a direct result of evading ingroup-outgroup boundaries. However, despite the desire for a plurality of opinions, the movement's leaders have been known to take political positions that are largely left-leaning. We use the first dataset known to gather this identity from a sample of Protestant clergy, and assess whether denominationally connected emergent church clergy do, in fact, present a distinctive political profile. Emergent clergy are what they say they are-diverse and inclusive-while they are, on average, more liberal than nonemergent clergy in the sample.  2014 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1402;2014;The fall of communist regimes in Central and Eastern Europe has profoundly changed the religious landscape in many countries. Sociologists have studied the rise and decline of religious beliefs and participation in the post-communist region, but economic approaches have been rare. This article suggests supplementing the dominant theories-the demand-side explanation of secularization and the supply-side explanation of religious revivals-with a model of individual time allocation. The model presented in the article predicts both the initial growth and the subsequent decline of religious participation in postcommunist countries. The empirical portion of the article focuses on six central European countries with different levels of religiosity. Data from the three waves of the ISSP survey support the model.  2014 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1403;2014;The inherent unity of all phenomena, or oneness, is a central concept of mysticism, but there have heretofore been no measures of oneness beliefs. We developed the Oneness Beliefs Scale, with spiritual and physical oneness subscales. The spiritual oneness subscale fills a need in the field for a short, reliable measure of spirituality not characterized by the language of traditional Western religiousness. The physical oneness subscale allows researchers to juxtapose spiritual beliefs with a nonspiritual, materialist counterpart. We found that spiritual oneness beliefs were more strongly related to mystic experiences and spirituality than to traditional religiousness. Physical oneness was not strongly associated with either religiousness or spirituality. Both spiritual and physical oneness were positively associated with pro-environmental attitudes but not with depression, anxiety, or negative affect. Spiritual oneness was a better predictor of pro-environmental attitudes than was religiousness. Spiritual oneness also predicted donating to a pro-environmental group, making this to our knowledge the first empirical study to show a positive association between a religion or spirituality measure and observed, rather than self-reported, pro-environmental behavior.  2014 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1404;2014;The purpose of this research note is to summarize the available data on trends in religious attendance across 24 European countries to determine whether a base level has been reached in some countries. We focus on the changes observed in the period 1990-2012. After critically assessing the data quality of the recent European Social Survey (ESS) and European Values Study (EVS), we present four different methods of assessing current trends. First, we assess intercohort differentials, an indicator previously used extensively. We then look at trends in young people's rates of attendance, followed by trends of the postwar cohorts born in 1950-1981. We proceed to an appraisal of individual life-course variations by looking at attendance as a child and young adult. A compilation of these indicators shows that they often do not fully agree on whether there is growth, decline, or stability. To generalize, the high-attending Catholic countries are more likely to exhibit religious decline, whilst a few ex-communist countries are seeing sustained growth. The most secular countries seem to be generally stabilizing in the 5-20 percent range for attendance rates of the postwar generations.  2014 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1405;2014;The relationship between Islam and war has been the focus of lively debates. While terrorism experts might find a holy war wherever they look, others deny the role of faith in motivating violence. While no conflict is entirely inspired by faith, nor is any conflict entirely without it, the degree of religious motivation matters a great deal. How does one gauge the religiosity of a given conflict? We identify three dominant approaches: citing scripture, citing militant leaders, and quantifying religious divisions. While each approach makes valuable contributions, none help us to understand the degree to which a given struggle is understood by Muslim communities to be sacred. Based on rural fieldwork in three Southeast Asian secessionist conflicts, this article provides a series of empirical indicators of religious conflict: the religious credentials of rebel leaders, recruitment networks, public discourse, and burial practices. Burial practices for fallen rebels provide especially novel insights into how conflicts are understood by local religious officials and Muslim communities, offering a new window into understanding religiosity as perceived by internal audiences.  2014 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1406;2014;The relationship between religion and trust is complex and there is little consensus on why, in general, religious people appear to be more trusting than their unaffiliated peers. Most research on religion and trust focuses on differences between traditions and denominations, which offers rather limited insight into the genesis of trust for religious persons. In this study, we draw on recent theoretical developments in social psychology to explore how specific patterns of social interactions within congregations enhance within-congregation trust among members to the benefit of both churches and individuals. Using survey data from the Portraits of American Life Study, we find that the positive relationship between religiosity and trust is driven less by religious beliefs or practices and more by particular characteristics of micro-level processes that occur in churches (e.g., closeness of relationships to religious leaders, density of congregational ties, and both giving and receiving aid from other congregation members). In light of research on social learning and trust, we also discuss the potential benefits of this particularized trust for individuals' levels of generalized trust.  2014 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1407;2014;The third wave of the National Congregations Study (NCS-III) was conducted in 2012. The 2012 General Social Survey asked respondents who attend religious services to name their religious congregation, producing a nationally representative cross-section of congregations from across the religious spectrum. Data about these congregations were collected via a 50-minute interview with one key informant from 1,331 congregations. Information was gathered about multiple aspects of congregations' social composition, structure, activities, and programming. Approximately two-thirds of the NCS-III questionnaire replicates items from 1998 or 2006-2007 NCS waves. Each congregation was geocoded, and selected data from the 2010 U.S. Census or American Community Survey have been appended. We describe NCS-III methodology and use the cumulative NCS dataset (containing 4,071 cases) to describe five trends: more ethnic diversity, greater acceptance of gays and lesbians, increasingly informal worship styles, declining size (but not from the perspective of the average attendee), and declining denominational affiliation.  2014 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1408;2014;Theories and empirical evidence regarding prayer behavior generally emerge from studies of survey respondents in developed countries. The research we describe here adds to the literature by exploring links between demographic characteristics and the frequency and content of prayers for respondents in rural Tanzania. We surveyed 349 Christian households from six villages in the country's Kilimanjaro region. In some aspects our findings match results from survey research conducted elsewhere, and in other aspects our results differ from those commonly reported in the literature. We suggest that local cultural and socioeconomic conditions may account for the differences in outcomes. These results suggest a need for caution in applying to poor countries theories and expectations drawn from the developed country context.  2014 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1409;2014;There has been little research on the effects of education on religion and spirituality in Chinese societies. This gap is addressed through quantitative analysis of a new dataset, the Religious Experience Survey in Taiwan, in conjunction with the repeated cross-sectional Taiwan Social Change Survey. In Taiwan, people with higher education are less likely than others to say that they have a religion, to worship or pray frequently, and to regard those activities as important. They are more likely, however, to express an interest in mystical or supernatural things, and to report a variety of religious experiences. This paradox arises not because the educated Taiwanese are spiritual but not religious, but rather because they are somewhat polarized: those who have no religion and those reporting religious experiences are not the same individuals. Although education is highly correlated with both birth cohort and income, the findings strongly suggest that education is the key explanatory variable. The official promotion of Confucian thought and its adoption by the educated elite helps to explain the surprising conjunction of declining religious affiliation and increased engagement with spirituality.  2014 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1410;2014;"This article develops a theoretical explanation for the incidence of sacrifice and stigma or ""strictness"" that-unlike the extant literature-explicitly incorporates a supernatural motive for religiosity. This innovation permits a precise delineation of religious risks and leads to the critical insight that ""strictness"" is an instrument of mutually beneficial risk mitigation. The theory yields alternative explanations for all empirical regularities on the incidence of strictness that the club model explains, including the seemingly anomalous labor market behavior of Ultra-Orthodox Jews in Israel, the high lethality of extremist religious sects, and the positive correlation between strictness and social service provision. Among the attributes that distinguish the risk mitigation approach from the club model are: its explanation of observed income dispersion within strictness categories that is substantially greater than that implied by the club model; its prediction that the positive correlation between strictness and exclusivity is a causal relationship in which exclusivity is causally prior to strictness; and its demonstration that variation in the risk mitigation benefits members derive from strictness is at least as important as variation in the opportunity costs of strictness in explaining variation in the levels of strictness employed across denominations and sects.  2014 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1411;2014;This article examines relations between social integration into host societies, religio-ethnic acculturation into group belonging, and ties to home country among Israeli migrs in the United States and Europe. I use data from a 2009-2010 Internet survey into which I incorporated country-contextual characteristics. The results of multivariate analyses show that a social integration combining duration of residence abroad and local citizenship enhances religio-ethnic identification. Another measure of integration, social networks, deters group behaviors. All measures of general integration inhibit attachment to the home country, whereas religio-ethnic acculturation is largely insignificant for transnationalism. The religiosity of the new country does not influence immigrants' religio-ethnic patterns or homeland attachment. Insofar as group size is a significant determinant of particularistic behaviors, it weakens them. The more policy-based opportunities newcomers receive, the more they dissociate from group behaviors and homeland ties. Irrespective of individual and contextual factors, living in the United States encourages group affiliation more than living in Europe does. The results are discussed in reference to four working hypotheses-marginalization, integration, assimilation, and separation-and from a U.S.-European comparative perspective.  2014 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1412;2014;"This article examines the influence of three dimensions of religion-belonging (faith tradition membership), behaving (frequency of service attendance), and context (one's relationship to aggregate population characteristics)-on attitudes toward multiple forms of state-provided social protection, or welfare attitudes. To do so, this article uses data from 17 countries surveyed in the 2006 ""Role of Government"" wave of the International Social Survey Program (ISSP). Results from mixed effects regression show that contextual effects are highly predictive of welfare attitudes. Nations that are more religiously heterogeneous are less supportive of state protection, while nations that are more homogeneous, particularly Catholic nations, are more supportive. Results hold net of fractionalization, political institutional measures, and economic characteristics. At the individual level, all three dimensions of religiosity are predictive of welfare attitudes. These patterns suggest that in rich Western democracies, religion continues to play an important role in structuring the moral economies.  2014 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1413;2014;This article provides a microlevel perspective of the interacting dynamics between religion and the Chinese state, demonstrating how religious leaders and local officials negotiate with each other pragmatically, continually withstanding pressure from hardline religious masses and state bureaucracy. This perspective, constructed using qualitative data on the True Jesus Church, also helps to answer a critical empirical question left open in scholarly discussions: When and how does the state regulative power on religion come to the fore in the economic reform emphasizing pragmatic religion-state cooperation? The findings show how religious leaders and local officials have become pragmatic, cooperating to form a dyadic nexus that tackles regular affairs in a practical way, though it may run the risk of fracture when lay members and bureaucratic superiors pressure leaders and officials, respectively, to take hardline positions. The leaders and officials have continually fought two-front battles while shuttling between negotiations with their nexus partner and aligning with their hardline sources of pressure. This study may shed light on future research of the Chinese religion-state relationship in general by illustrating a microlevel, integrative, dynamic approach.  2014 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1414;2014;This article uses the occasion of the Secular Coalition for America's first-ever congressional briefing as a case study for demonstrating the political advantages a polysemous secular affords secular lobbyists. The briefing, conducted primarily for the benefit of staff members from the U.S. House of Representatives, offers a rare public forum in which the Secular Coalition tried to strike a balance between the two halves of its mission: advocating for nontheists and promoting secular government. In its efforts to fulfill this mission, the Secular Coalition conflates and distinguishes between four distinct meanings of the secular and secularism: the separation of church and state, the secular public sphere, the ideology of nonbelief, and a nascent secular identity. By studying the ongoing efforts of secular activists to redefine the place and meaning of the secular and the religious in American life, this article contributes to the study of how the secular gets made, who makes it, and why.  2014 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1415;2014;"This paper examines award-winning Jewish children's literature as a medium to explore how religiosity gets constructed differently for men and women. We analyze three decades of winners of the Sydney Taylor Jewish Book Award, a prestigious annual award given by the Association of Jewish Libraries to an outstanding Jewish children's book. We demonstrate how these award-winning books produce and perpetuate gendered religious stereotypes that associate men with agency and women with communion. We also show how these books construct images of a ""domestic Judaism"" for women and a ""public Judaism"" for men and how women have been symbolically annihilated from the titles and central character roles in these books. Drawing on Cecilia Ridgeway's (2011) gender-framing perspective, we argue that the gender stereotypes evident in these books matter to society because they produce and enforce gender inequalities in religiousness.  2014 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1416;2014;This study examines how a desire to pass on religious heritage shapes whites' attitudes toward interracial marriage for their children. Utilizing national survey data (Baylor Religion Survey 2007), I estimate ordered logit regression models to examine the extent to which whites' desire to have their children and children's spouses share their religion affects attitudes toward their hypothetical daughters marrying blacks, Latinos, or Asians, net of other factors. Analyses reveal that whites who consider it more important that their children and children's spouses share their religion are less comfortable with their daughters marrying blacks, Latinos, or Asians. These effects are robust to the inclusion of measures for religiosity, political ideology, intimate interracial experiences, and other sociodemographic correlates. These findings suggest that, for whites, religious heritage has a clear ethno-racial component. The greater their desire for descendants to share the same religious views, the more whites would prefer that these descendants themselves be white, indicating that, for many white Americans, religious heritage is equated with whiteness. I conclude by discussing the implications of these findings for research on religion and interracial families.  2014 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1417;2014;"This study has three goals. The first is to see whether the opportunity to engage in volunteer work at church fosters friendships with co-religionists. The second goal is to see whether the support these friends provide bolsters feelings of gratitude to God. The third goal is to see whether feelings of gratitude to God are associated with health and depressive symptoms. The following linkages in our conceptual model elaborate and extend these objectives: (1) people who go to church more often will be more likely to participate in volunteer work through their congregations; (2) individuals who perform volunteer work at church will have more friends among their co-religionists; (3) people who have more friends where they worship will report receiving more emotional support from fellow congregants; (4) those who receive more support from co-religionists will feel more grateful to God; and (5) individuals who are more grateful to God will rate their health in a more favorable manner and experience fewer symptoms of depression. Data from the U.S. Congregational Life Survey provide support for each of these relationships.  2014 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1418;2014;Western pressures for thinness tell women that having a thin body makes a person worthy. Two factors that may provide alternative means of self-worth are religion and general commitment to a meaningful goal. This study experimentally tested whether religious-affirming statements buffered against exposure to thin models for everyone, or only for women with strong religious commitment. It also examined the relationships among religious commitment, general commitment, and body satisfaction. One hundred eleven women at a religious-affiliated college completed the commitment scales and baseline body measures. They were later randomly assigned to read one set of affirming statements, after which they then completed body measures again. Results showed that religious commitment buffered against exposure to ultrathin models. Women who were strongly religiously committed and who read religious statements that affirmed the body showed higher body esteem. Correlation results showed that general commitment was positively related to body esteem, body satisfaction, and healthy dieting. Religious commitment was positively related to body esteem and body satisfaction. Results are discussed in relation to schemas and depth of processing. Practical implications are discussed.  2014 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1419;2014;"Why and how do nations turn to religion to justify claims for statehood? This article addresses this question in both theory and practice, showing that religion plays multiple legitimating roles that shift dynamically according to the success they yield for national movements. I posit four legitimating models: (1) nationalism instead of religion (""secular nationalism""), (2) nationalism as a religion (""civil religion""), (3) religion as a resource for nationalism (""auxiliary religion""), and (4) religion as a source of nationalism (""chosen people""). Empirically, I analyze the roles of religion in Zionist efforts to legitimate a Jewish state in Palestine. I argue that Zionism has responded to persistent delegitimation by expanding the role of religion in its political legitimation. The right of self-determination, which stands at the core of the ""secular Zionism"" legitimation, has given way to leveraging Judaism, which in turn has been eclipsed by constructing a Zionist civil religion and a ""chosen people"" justification.  2014 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1420;2015;Although there is much discussion of educational needs and how to integrate Muslim students into modern Western contexts, there is a shortage of research on teachers' attitudes about these issues. Finland offers a particularly interesting context for research, given its relatively new, small, yet rapidly growing Muslim population, its prominence of negative attitudes to visible religiosity, and its official policy of multiculturalism. This article presents the results of a quantitative study of Finnish teachers' attitudes to Muslim students and to their integration into Finnish schools. A nonprobability sample of Finnish preservice and practicing teachers (N = 864) was surveyed and the resulting data analyzed with exploratory factor analysis, t-tests, and ANOVA. The results indicate that Finnish teachers consider learning about general democratic values important, but their attitudes to dealing with Islam and Muslims are not quite as positive. However, previous involvement with other cultures indicated more positive attitudes among preservice teachers. Female teachers and practicing teachers were more oriented toward the teaching of commonality, and teaching at a more advanced level indicated more positive attitudes to Muslims and Muslim integration.  2015 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1421;2015;Are women universally more religious than men? Some research on gender differences has argued that biology leads women to be innately more religious than men, but other research has highlighted the importance of avoiding universal claims and recognizing complexity. This brief note uses General Social Survey data to report gender differences in predicted religiosity by religious category across eight measures. In the United States, gender differences seem to be primarily a Christian phenomenon. Although women reveal higher levels of religiosity across Christian groups, this trend does not extend to non-Christian groups. Furthermore, there is variation even among Christian groups, with women not revealing higher levels of religiosity for all measures. Nevertheless, there does seem to be a general trend for women to report daily prayer more often than men. These findings further problematize the idea that there are innate gender differences in religiosity rooted in biology, and provide a descriptive foundation for future attempts to explain why (American) Christian groups reveal gender differences in religiosity.  2015 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1422;2015;"Based on interviews with converts to Eastern Orthodox Christianity in the United States, this article documents and analyzes a narrative form in which conversion is described as the progressive discovery of a latent religious self that was part of one's life all along, or what I term a conversion to continuity. These findings contrast markedly with those of most contemporary conversion research, which emphasize the narration of a dramatic temporal break between converts' past and present religious selves (epitomized by the evangelical ""born-again"" genre). I examine how and why temporal continuity was a characteristic feature of these conversion accounts and demonstrate how such narratives helped constitute forms of religious experience and self-identity that differ in important respects from those documented in previous studies. In light of these findings, I argue for a reconceptualization of continuity and discontinuity within processes of religious identity change as an institutionally anchored figure/ground relationship as opposed to an either/or dichotomy. I also highlight promising avenues for future comparative research on the relationships between time, narrative, and subjectivity across religious and secular contexts.  2015 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."

Based on a framework of collective identity construction (boundary work, oppositional consciousness, identity assertion) into which a taxonomy of speech acts (accusations, declarations, directives, exhortations, prescriptions, and warnings) are organized, our content analysis illustrates how revolutionary we-ness is constituted, and how the recursive employment of speech acts suggests a resonance of ideological motives in religious discourse. We found the degree to which identity assertion, expressed in declarative speech acts, predominated over oppositional consciousness, which in turn figured over boundary work in the constitution of revolutionary we-ness. Our speech acts approach fills a void in framing theory and confirms religious discourse's capacity to promote radical self-understandings and commitment to revolutionary activism.  2015 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1424;2015;"Clergy fulfill vital societal functions as meaning makers and community builders. Partly because of their important roles, clergy frequently encounter stressful situations. Further, studies suggest that clergy experience high rates of depression. Despite this, few studies have examined protective factors for clergy that may increase their positive mental health. We invited all United Methodist clergy in North Carolina to participate in a survey. Of church-serving clergy, 85 percent responded (n = 1,476). Hierarchical multiple regression was used to assess the predictors of three positive and four negative mental health outcomes. The three sets of predictors were: demographics, which explained 2-10 percent of the variances; variables typically related to mental health (social support, social isolation, and financial stress), which explained 14-41 percent of the variances; and clergy-specific variables, which explained 14-20 percent of the variances, indicating the importance of measuring occupation-specific variables. Some variables (e.g., congregation demands) significantly related to both positive and negative mental health, whereas others (e.g., positive congregations, congregation support) significantly related primarily to positive mental health. In addition to their intervention implications, these findings support separate consideration for negative versus positive mental health.  2016 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1425;2015;Despite the pervasiveness of Catholicism among Latinos, studies reveal an increasing shift toward Protestantism. Examining the relationship between religion and ethnicity, we explore homeland language use as a core ethnic marker using a survey from the Pew Hispanic Center. Results reveal that Catholic Latinos are significantly more likely to use Spanish at home, even after controlling for other key variables. In response, we posit that Latino Catholicism and Protestantism entail significantly different religiosities in both home and host countries that impact Latino ethnic identification and its markers such as language use. Catholicism displays a higher level of inculturation in the sending country and greater overt institutional acceptance of ethnic culture in host countries. Protestantism in Latin America breaks with localized religiosity and traditions, and U.S. Protestant congregations may de-emphasize ethnic culture in their theologies and worship. Hence, Latino Catholicism acts as a bridge to homelands and reinforces ethnic salience, thereby supporting continued Spanish use at home. In contrast, Protestants embrace a reorienting religiosity that often presides over ethnic identification, decreasing the salience of homeland cultural markers.  2015 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1426;2015;"Does adherence to Islam predict attitudes about ""suicide bombing"" among American Muslims? This study examines the effects of religious and political factors on views of politically motivated violence (PMV). We draw from diverse scholarship, emphasizing arguments that are inspired by Samuel Huntington's Clash of Civilizations perspective, as well as recent work in the sociology of Islam. Using a measure that gauges support for ""suicide bombing"" from the 2007 Pew Survey of American Muslims, results from logistic regression models suggest that political views and religious factors have a minimal effect on Muslim American attitudes toward suicide bombing. Furthermore, we find that Qur'anic authoritativeness (i.e., the view that the Qur'an is the word of God and not written by men) is associated with lower odds of supporting this form of PMV. We discuss the implications of our findings for the often anecdotal and alarmist accounts that link Muslim religiosity to support for ""radical"" extremism. We close with study limitations and avenues of future research.  2015 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1427;2015;How do religious denominations select potential adherents? Previous literature indicates that market niches direct this decision, yet few studies examine how religious groups determine their niche. Analyzing annual reports and periodicals of Reform and Conservative Jewish organizations from 1910 to 1955, I find that the two denominations responded differently to the mass influx of Jewish immigrants at the turn of the 20th century. Compared to the Conservative organization, which openly welcomed new immigrants, the Reform organization actively chose not to recruit them. Reform statements make it clear that this decision was a result of how working-class, Eastern European immigrants threatened their American-centered organizational identity. This finding suggests that religious institutions carefully consider their organizational identity based on nativity, ethnicity, and social class when determining whom to include in their market niche.  2015 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1428;2015;"I examine the relationship between religious service attendance and two domains (cognitive and affective) of subjective well-being using Gallup Daily Poll data, which has a sample size over 1.3 million. I find that religious attendance is positively associated with both domains of subjective well-being in all religious traditions examined, including non-Christian traditions and ""religious nones."" The strength of the association varies significantly across the traditions: stronger among Christian groups-particularly among the groups that are, on average, more observant-than among non-Christian religions or ""religious nones."" The stronger association among the observant groups is partly due to the lower level of well-being among nonattendees in those groups than nonattendees in less observant groups. I also find that the association is stronger among individuals who consider religion an important part of life than among those who do not. Finally, my findings suggest that religious service attendance is equally strongly related to both domains of subjective well-being.  2016 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1429;2015;In this article, we examine how leaders of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (LDS) discursively constructed homosexuality over the last 50 years. Based on textual analysis of LDS talks, magazines, and other publications, we analyze how LDS elites, responding to shifting historical, cultural, and religious interpretations of sexualities, discursively constructed homosexuality as problematic for (1) society from the 1950s to the 1990s, (2) the family from the 1970s to present, and (3) divinely inspired gender roles from the 1980s to present. Further, we show how LDS elites softened their rhetoric in the 1990s, and in so doing, established a new discursive construction of homosexuality as an ailment requiring sympathetic treatment. Throughout our analysis, we also examine how LDS elites accomplished such discursive work in response to shifting societal and religious attitudes concerning sexual minorities. In conclusion, we draw out implications for understanding how religious elites discursively construct sexual norms, the reciprocal relationship between sexual and religious discourse and advocacy, and the importance of examining how dominant religious discourses change over time.  2015 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1430;2015;In this study we analyze veiling as an Islamic religious practice among Turkish and Moroccan immigrant women in the Netherlands, investigating whether the strength of religious identity, education, contact with natives, and gender role attitudes can explain who veils and who does not. Confirming stereotypical interpretations of the veil as a religious symbol of a strongly gendered religion, we find that a strong Muslim identity and traditional gender role attitudes are positively associated with veiling. While our results seem to support predictions that contact with natives and education relate negatively with wearing a headscarf, these relationships with veiling are more complex. Education strengthens the positive relation between religious identification and veiling, indicating that most highly educated women endorse veiling as a religious practice if they are more religious. Contact with Dutch, however, weakens the association between religious identification and veiling, meaning socially well integrated women veil less often even if they are religious. We discuss our findings against the background of previous qualitative research on veiling as a religious practice and regarding theories on immigrant religion in Europe.  2015 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1431;2015;"Is religion more of an integrative or a divisive force in contemporary societies? We use multilevel analyses of World Values Survey data from 77,409 individuals in 69 countries to examine how both the percent of the population that is religious and the religious heterogeneity of a country are related to generalized social trust, the willingness of individuals to trust ""most people."" When we first examine the main effects of the percent religious and religious heterogeneity we find no evidence that either variable is related to trust in the ways predicted by major theories. However, the combination of these two variables has a huge negative relationship with trust. Countries that are both highly religious and religiously heterogeneous (diverse) have, on average, levels of trust that are only half the average levels of countries with other combinations of these two variables. The results have important implications for understanding the role of religion in modern societies.  2016 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1432;2015;Many previous studies have linked religiosity to social trust. Yet much of this relation remains insufficiently understood, which is partly due to the fact that religiosity is a multidimensional phenomenon. In this article, we identify several of those dimensions, including the integration in religious communities, the importance of God in people's lives, and the religious context. These dimensions give rise to different mechanisms that produce both trust-enhancing and trust-reducing effects. Data from the European Values Survey (2008) were used to test the resulting hypotheses, using multilevel logistic regression models. We conclude that the micro effects are ambivalent: integration in religious communities furthers trust, whereas religious socialization and the importance of God lower trust. On the macro level, we find a strong effect of Protestantism, which is in line with previous studies, but that remains puzzling since the individual-level difference between Protestants and the other religious traditions was found to be very small. In addition, in contrast to other studies, we found that religious diversity increases social trust.  2016 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1433;2015;Next to congregations, religious nonprofit organizations represent one of the most numerous categories of religious organizations in the United States. However, very few data exist that shed light on this sector. In this research note we introduce new data from a survey of two cohorts of religion-related public charities, also known as 501(c)(3)s or simply as religious nonprofits. We also present initial findings from these data. Specifically, we provide a descriptive profile of religious nonprofits' founders and how these individuals compare to leaders and founders of other organizations, including congregations. We also provide a descriptive profile of these organizations' activities, staffing, and structure. This note serves as the first step in what we hope will be an expanding literature on religious nonprofit organizations.  2015 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1434;2015;One of the surprising oversights of existing research on racially/ethnically diverse congregations is the inattention to how racial composition relates to patterns of attendance. Is diversity associated with attendance growth, stability, or decline? A popular assumption from the Church Growth Movement is that cultural homogeneity is a foundation for growth, but recent research challenges this long-standing belief. We test these competing views with longitudinal data from over 10,000 congregations in the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA). We examine the relationship between changes in racial/ethnic diversity and changes in average weekly attendance over a 19-year time period (1993-2012). In spite of the ELCA's denominational push for racial diversity in its local churches, our analysis finds increasing racial diversity associated with decreasing average attendance, most notably during the 1990s. To conclude, we discuss the implications of our findings for congregations and denominations.  2016 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1435;2015;Religious freedom is a highly valued goal for many citizens and political leaders around the world, especially in Western-oriented nations. Much ink has been spilled in defense of religious freedom and many have waxed eloquent about the virtues of promoting religious freedom. Most constitutions and other international documents around the world guarantee religious freedom even if those guarantees are sometimes honored in the breach. Why this focus on religious freedom is occurring and how it is being addressed are the focus of this article.  2015 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1436;2015;"Research finds that Americans who espouse theologically conservative beliefs about the Bible generally oppose same-sex marriage. Studies exploring this link, however, have been limited in that their operationalization of fundamentalist belief has been problematically conceptualized and they have potentially confounded the effect of conservative religious identity. The current study asks: (1) How do distinct beliefs about the nature and authority of the Bible influence same-sex marriage support? (2) Do these beliefs influence same-sex marriage support independently of conservative religious identity? (3) To what extent do Bible beliefs and conservative religious identity moderate one another's effects? And (4) to what extent are these factors moderated by religious tradition and frequency of Bible reading? Analyses of 2006 Portraits of American Life Study data reveal that while identifying as religiously conservative is the strongest predictor of opposition to same-sex marriage, believing in inerrancy and creationism remain strong predictors in full models. I also find moderating effects between belief in creationism, inerrancy, inspiration; religious-conservative identity; and religious tradition. Findings clarify how theological beliefs and religious identity shape support for same-sex marriage across religious traditions.  2016 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1437;2015;"Research inspired by terror management theory has established that being reminded of the inevitability of death (i.e., ""mortality salience"") leads people to express more negative attitudes toward out-groups. We examined the hypothesis that being affiliated with a religion may buffer individuals against this negative impact of mortality salience. Two studies, conducted in two cultures that differ in their emphasis on religiosity (the United Kingdom and Italy), supported this hypothesis. Specifically, we found that mortality salience resulted in more negative out-group attitudes only among participants not affiliated with any religion. Further, this buffering effect of religious affiliation was not moderated by participants' specific religious orientations or by their levels of social dominance orientation. In addition, the buffering effect did not hold when prejudice against the target out-group was not proscribed by religious authorities. Implications for research on religion, prejudice, and terror management are discussed.  2016 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1438;2015;Social science researchers have increasingly come to utilize Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk) to obtain adult, opt-in samples for use with experiments. Based on the demographic characteristics of MTurk samples, studies have provided some support for the representativeness of MTurk. Others have warranted caution based on demographic characteristics and comparisons of reliability. Yet, what is missing is an examination of the most glaring demographic difference in MTurk-religion. We compare five MTurk samples with a student convenience sample and the 2012 General Social Survey, finding that MTurk samples have a consistent bias toward nonreligion. MTurk surveys significantly overrepresent seculars and underrepresent Catholics and evangelical Protestants. We then compare the religiosity of religious identifiers across samples as well as relationships between religiosity and partisanship, finding many similarities and a few important differences from the general population.  2015 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1439;2015;"Systematic observational studies of the chaplain's role and function in the secular health-care setting are few.With an episode-based diary recorded on handheld digital tablets, palliative care chaplains at a large urban hospital with a diverse patient population recorded details of patient visits in near-real time. Cluster analysis revealed groups of activities we called ""doing"" and ""being,"" and conversation topics of ""practical matters"" and ""ultimate concerns"", chaplains were most satisfied with visits that involved all of these. Chaplains offer patients and families a space to express significant concerns; however, visits with spiritual or religious activities or topics were relatively rare. Broad quality of life concerns are central to the evolving professional role of chaplains in the secular setting of the modern hospital.  2016 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1440;2015;The current investigation explored prevalence, predictors, and psychological implications of religious and spiritual (r/s) struggles among an Israeli-Palestinian, Muslim sample. R/s struggle was assessed by the Religious and Spiritual Struggles Scale (Exline etal. 2014), a newly developed scale that assesses a wide array of r/s struggles. Factor analysis of the scale in this study revealed five factors of struggle: Divine and Doubt, Punitive Entities, Interpersonal, Moral, and Ultimate Meaning. Of the 139 Muslim participants, between 1.4 percent and 40.2 percent experienced various r/s struggles. Positive God image and fundamentalism predicted lower levels of struggle, whereas negative God image and universality predicted higher levels of struggle. After controlling for religious variables, we found that both depressive symptoms and generalized anxiety were predicted by Punitive Entities and Ultimate Meaning struggles, while satisfaction with life was predicted by Interpersonal struggle. Possible explanations and implications of the findings are offered, and the limitations of the study are discussed.  2016 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1441;2015;"The debate over religious change in Italy is far from having reached unanimous conclusions: some scholars point to an unbroken trend toward a decrease of religiosity, while others highlight the signs of a religious revival, especially in younger generations. Besides difficulties with definitions, different conclusions are also due to a lack of information over a sufficiently long period of time. This problem is tackled here by developing a pooled analysis of repeated cross-section surveys that span over four decades. Using six different studies, the article analyzes the secularization trend in Italy on the basis of church attendance that, despite well-founded criticism, continues to be a crucial indicator of this phenomenon. The results, estimated using multilevel models, show that the trend of attendance at Mass in Italy has decreased since the 1960s until today, despite a period of stability at the turn of the 1980s and 1990s. The overall trend looks like a ""recumbent S"" trend (decrease up to the 1970s, stability in the 1980s, decrease afterwards). Thus, the claims of a religious revival in Italy are not supported by our results.  2015 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1442;2015;"The debates in the Turkish Grand National Assembly (1923-1928) and the Indian Constituent Assembly (1946-1949) inscribed the secular infrastructures of these states into law. A close examination of these debates shows that while the separation of religion and state was an important aspect of Turkish and Indian secularisms, both allowed the state to intervene in the religious sphere. In both, state intervention in religion sought to transform the majority religion into a secularized and modernized form that would complement national identity. However, whereas Turkish secularism adopted ""restrictive intervention,"" which sanctions state interference to construct a monolithic national identity, the Indian nationalist leaders adopted ""emancipative intervention,"" which seeks to create an overarching national identity while preserving the cultural and religious diversity of society. While the former type of secularist intervention limits religion's public visibility and places it under state control, the latter seeks to eliminate and reform religious practices that hinder social justice and equality. Based on this analysis, I argue that secularism may be seen as a tool state authorities utilize in the service of the political project of creating a modern nation.  2015 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1443;2015;The experiences of men in traditional religions are complex, at times inconsistent, and not necessarily the direct result of religious teachings. This article draws from two qualitative case studies to examine the ways in which evangelical and Latter-Day Saint men understand masculinity and their spiritual beliefs in the context of sexual activity. The authors present two masculine practices-acceptance of sexual rejection and sexual indifference-that allow religious men in this study to simultaneously challenge and uphold the system of hegemonic masculinity that their traditions promote. These findings point to the moments when creative, interpretative work helps religious men to reconcile their experiences with religious expectations and to alleviate the tensions they face in their everyday lives. This article offers new insights into how gender and sexuality studies may be integrated into the sociology of religion.  2015 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1444;2015;"The number of individuals claiming a nonreligious identity in the United States is on the rise, with one-fourth of the overall U.S. public failing to identify with any of the major religious traditions. In this article, we examine whether religious disaffiliation structures social network formation in a social context in which religious identification (and religiosity) is a salient cultural marker. We take advantage of unique data on the personal networks of youth transitioning into a college where religion is a culturally salient facet of everyday life. We hypothesize that, if there is nonreligious homophily, it may result from an attraction of the disaffiliated to each other or from a repulsion away from the religiously affiliated. Results of exponential random graph models suggest that both mechanisms may be at play. We find that religious ""Nones"" and affiliated non-Catholics are disproportionately more likely to form and maintain relationships with one another and are relatively less likely to form and maintain relationships with members of their respective religious out-groups. We close by outlining the implications of our findings and delineating promising avenues for future research.  2016 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1445;2015;The political environment for evangelical Protestants has changed substantially since the Christian Right reached its apex, as a more issue and ideologically diffuse political environment has emerged. The present study tests two different theoretical perspectives on whether these contextual changes may have altered Millennial evangelicals' political perspectives vis--vis those of previous generations of evangelicals. On the one hand, theoretical perspectives related to differential political socialization processes across generations would lead to expectations of generational change among evangelicals. On the other hand, theoretical perspectives related to social identity theory would suggest far less change across generations. Using Pew's 2007 U.S. Religious Landscape Survey, we test these expectations by comparing the relationships between religiosity and political attitudes across three generations of evangelicals. Ordered probit and logistic regression models estimate the impact of religiosity on various political attitudes. These models reveal that Millennial evangelical religiosity continues to be strongly related to Republican Party identification and opposition toward abortion, which is largely consistent with the social identity perspective. Generational change is most evident in a variety of nonsocial issues in which religiosity is associated with less conservatism among Millennials. Additional analysis using the 2012 Religion and Politics Survey with a smaller sample of Millennial evangelicals confirms these results.  2015 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1446;2015;"The publication of 12 cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammad by the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten on September 30, 2005, created a great deal of controversy over self-censorship, freedom of speech, and accusations of religious incitement. Muslim activists organized protests, and later hundreds of people were killed and hundreds of others were injured due to violent reactions to the cartoons. This article focuses on how people used YouTube to react to these cartoons by analyzing 261 video clips and 4,153 comments. Results show that the majority of the video clips and comments were moderate and positive in tone toward Islam and Muhammad; however, a small percentage either called for jihad against the West or made lethal threats against the artist. Other comments carried curses or insults against Denmark, while a few others were anti-Islamic. The fact that these online reactions were highly varied in tone suggests that the online public sphere is very much divided.  2015 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1447;2015;There has been much work on the effects that individual prayer has on a variety of social-psychological indicators, yet there remains a lack of research on collective prayer. While it is tempting to assume that collective prayer may be analyzed as the aggregate of individual prayers, the research presented in this article suggests that worshipers pray differently when in community than when by themselves. To understand the role of collective prayer in the practices of faith communities, I draw on work on group culture and ritual to create a framework for analyzing collective prayer. I assert that collective prayer represents a meaningful social performance that locates those conducting it within wider fields of meaning. I conclude with suggestions for future work, including examining how collective prayer acts as an element of conflict as well as unity.  2015 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1448;2015;This article examines the relationship between sexual orientation and religious experience of men from early adolescence to adulthood. Data have been obtained from an online survey of 1,042 males who were part of a larger sample of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer/questioning (LGBTQ) persons who are current or former members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (LDS, Mormon). While early religious experience was essentially identical to that of heterosexuals, the gap between religious norms and experience widened as these men moved through early and mid-adulthood. Those who married did so at a later age, and experienced a high rate of divorce. Continued participation, integration, and conformity to LDS ideals was not attributable to faith in, or a departure from, fundamental doctrinal belief. Instead, the responsible variable was sexual orientation, measured by the Kinsey Scale scores across behavior, attraction, and identity. For those near the exclusively homosexual end of the spectrum, the failure to change sexual orientation after intense effort over many years resulted in loss of belonging, belief, and participation, along with increased negative emotions and a sense of mistreatment.  2015 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1449;2015;This article explores the Jewish identity of different Jewish denominational identification groups using the Decade 2000 Data Set with its 19,800 interviews of Jewish households in 22 American Jewish communities. We relate the Jewish identity of individuals in each denominational group (Orthodox, Conservative, Reform/Reconstructionist) to the denominational composition of the community. Communities are clustered via k-means cluster analysis based on their denominational profiles. We examine the extent to which individual Jewish identification varies by the denominational composition of the community in which an individual resides, finding that considerable variation exists in Jewish identity measures depending on the type of denominational profile that exists in the individual's community. That is, Orthodox Jews, for example, behave differently in a community with a significant Orthodox population than in a community with few Orthodox, but many Reform Jews. Implications for Jewish communities, as well as for the broader interreligious community, are considered.  2015 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1450;2015;This article reports the results of a nationwide audit study testing how Christian churches welcome potential newcomers to their churches as a function of newcomers' race and ethnicity. We sent email inquiries to 3,120 churches across the United States. The emails were ostensibly from someone moving to the area and looking for a new church to attend. That person's name was randomly varied to convey different racial and ethnic associations. In response to these inquiries, representatives from mainline Protestant churches-who generally embrace liberal, egalitarian attitudes toward race relations-actually demonstrated the most discriminatory behavior. They responded most frequently to emails with white-sounding names, somewhat less frequently to black- or Hispanic-sounding names, and much less to Asian-sounding names. They also sent shorter, less welcoming responses to nonwhite names. In contrast, evangelical Protestant and Catholic churches showed little variation across treatment groups in their responses. These findings underscore the role of homophily, organizational homogeneity, and the costs of racial integration in perpetuating the racial segregation of American religious life.  2015 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1451;2015;This article takes the rate of new incorporations into the Catholic priesthood within national societies as a social fact revealing underlying societal tendencies of broad theoretical relevance extending well beyond the study of religion. Our emphasis lies on the impact of income inequality on the prevalence of altruistic life options. We examine cross-national and time-series variation in the priestly vocation rate as the empirical foundation to theorize social dynamics underpinning a life option that entails the renunciation of opportunities for individual material advantage alongside the commitment to serve a broader community. The article elaborates why we view the vocation rate as resting on a combination of piety and altruistic dispositions, and provides a theoretical rationale for expecting inequality to diminish this-and other-altruistic life options. We also examine the impact of other variables that have been theorized to influence the prevalence of Catholic clerical vocations and elaborate the broader theoretical relevance of our empirical findings.  2015 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1452;2015;"This article uses the case of the probability of being in employment among different ethno-religious groups in Britain over a period of 12 years (2002-2013) to illustrate how different degrees of labor market penalty in the United Kingdom are highly associated with the different processes of racialization they undergo in the United Kingdom. It is argued that what matters in producing the observed inequalities in the United Kingdom is the inescapable centrality of ""color"" (mainly blackness) and ""culture"" (particularly being Muslim) and the way different Muslim and black groups have been racialized. The findings of this study leave little doubt that there is a black and a Muslim penalty in the labor market, but at the same time it suggest that these penalties are not fixed but tend to vary in extent and nature.  2015 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1453;2015;This research used longitudinal data from the German Socio-Economic Panel Study (SOEP) to examine whether religious attendance buffers the impact of unemployment on life satisfaction. Fixed effects models following 5,446 individuals up to three years after the transition to unemployment yielded two central findings. First, higher frequency of religious attendance was associated with smaller drops in life satisfaction. Second, only those who attended religious services on a weekly basis adapted to unemployment. These results suggest that religious attendance on a weekly basis can mitigate the psychological impact of unemployment.  2015 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1454;2015;This study aimed to create and test a dream-specific version of Hood's Mysticism (M) Scale for the purpose of studying dreaming mystical experience. Factor analysis of the Spiritual Dreams Scale (SDS), based on data collected from 289 adults affiliated with an American evangelical Christian school, clearly resulted in three factors in accordance with prior studies of the M Scale. However, the factor composition of the SDS did not identically resemble the findings of previous studies of the M Scale. Instead, the three-factor solution suggested a Jamesian interpretation according to which the factors were labeled mystical psychology (passivity), perceived alternate reality (ineffability), and noesis. Scores on the SDS shared significant positive correlations with scores for absorption, dream beliefs, dream recall, and kataphatic prayer. A scale for apophatic prayer failed to share a significant correlation with the SDS.  2015 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1455;2015;This study examines the association between sense of divine involvement and sense of meaning in life. Then it proceeds to assess how this association varies by religious tradition. Using a random and national sample from the 2007 Baylor Religion Survey, this study finds that sense of divine involvement is associated with greater odds of having a sense of meaning in life. In addition, religious affiliation modifies this association. Specifically, the positive association between sense of divine involvement and the odds of having a sense of meaning in life is observed only among evangelical Protestants, mainline Protestants, and Catholics, but not among other religionists and religious nones. I discuss how the results make contributions to knowledge about the link between religious beliefs, religious tradition, and mental health.  2015 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1456;2015;"This study illustrates intergenerational religious mobility with the case of Chinese society. Using the quasi-symmetric log-linear model to separate structure mobility from exchange mobility, we examine the variation in religious identities between the reform era generation and their parents. Structure mobility results suggest that the encompassing social reform over the past decades in China has encouraged the structural growth of Islam and Christianity across generations, but traditional Chinese religions bear remarkable intergenerational disadvantages. Moreover, religious nones are growing across generations, at least relative to traditional Chinese religions. Exchange mobility findings indicate that individuals whose parents follow traditional Chinese religions are very likely to ""convert"" to Christianity. However, children of religious nones do not necessarily remain irreligious, possibly undermining the structural advantages of religious nones in the future. Finally, a comparison between cohort and period effects drives us to conclude that the major social force underpinning the revival of Chinese religion in the reform era is generational replacement instead of an increasingly religious transition of ""old"" generations.  2015 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1457;2015;This study measures the effect of regular worship attendance at age 17 on total years of schooling by age 25, using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997. Expanding on previous work, this study estimates differences in the impact of worship attendance by race and family income status using propensity score matching. Individuals who frequently attend religious services complete.69 more years of schooling than similar individuals who do not frequently attend services. There are significantly greater returns to attendance for low-income youth and no significant difference in returns by religious affiliation. These findings suggest that religious observance provides greater benefits for low-income individuals or perhaps provides resources high-income individuals have access to elsewhere. Moreover, this study extends previous work by examining a more recent and nationally representative sample of youth and by using methods that allow for greater causal inference.  2015 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1458;2015;"We examine aging patterns and generational trends in religion using 35 years of survey data from 420 four-generation families and in-depth interviews with a subset of 25 families. Results indicate the importance of three time-related effects on religiosity: individual aging and religious development over the life course; cohort influences; and effects of historical trends in religion. Results indicate an overall aging effect with an upward drift in religious intensity and strength of beliefs over the adult lifespan, though religious attendance remains generally stable over adulthood until it drops in late life. Growth curves show that the oldest generations (G1 and G2) display a ""retirement surge"" in religiosity. Trajectories of change for G3s and G4s reflect both lifecycle and cohort effects. Qualitative analysis provides insight concerning the generational differences identified in the survey, suggesting two trends: (1) from older- to later-born age groups, spirituality becomes increasingly decoupled from religion; (2) conceptualizations of the divine show a shift from a God who is primarily transcendent (""out there"") for the G1s to one that is more imminent and personal in the G4s.  2015 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1459;2015;We investigate the location patterns of organizations that embody key religious-spiritual traditions and that have grown to prominence in the latter 20th and early 21st centuries: evangelical churches, yoga, and martial arts. The distribution of key cultural organizations depends on the degree to which they are able to frame themselves in relation to one another and to core American traditions. Organizations associated with the American religious divide are more polarized in their social appeal and spatial distributions, and those framed as broadly neutral elements of popular culture are more widely distributed. Using a national database of local amenities, we find that theologically conservative churches are popular in many neighborhoods but concentrated in less-educated and nonwhite areas. Yoga studios are less geographically dispersed and more spatially concentrated in college-educated and white areas. Compared to these, martial arts schools, sports clubs, and other pop-culture amenities are more widely distributed across different types of areas.  2015 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1460;2015;We recruited 110 college students for an experimental investigation of the role of guilt in motivating religious behavior. We induced guilt in half of the participants before asking all subjects to indicate their current interest in prayer. Overall, participants in the guilt condition were more interested in praying, but this effect was not observed among those high in grandiose narcissism. Our findings make a contribution not only to the study of the role that emotions have in motivating religious behavior, but also to the study of narcissists' susceptibility to guilt.  2015 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1461;2015;"We used a mixed methods approach-including ethnographic fieldwork, interviews, and a survey-to study two innovative Christian contemplative worship services housed in a mainline Protestant congregation in a midwestern city. These services employed boundary-blurring practices designed to attract the ""de-churched""-those who had been involved in a Christian congregation in the past but who had at some point disengaged from organized religion. Though attracting some formerly de-churched participants, these services were far more successful in attracting several other constituencies united by their liberal theology and by a preference for loose connections. We argue that these worship services are best understood as thriving communities of sustained spiritual practice where contemplative rituals sacralize both theistic and extra-theistic, Christian and non-Christian, symbols and beliefs.  2016 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion."
1462;2015;While attribution theory expects that beliefs about the origins of homosexuality are directly related to beliefs about the moral acceptability of homosexual behavior, we use content analysis of the popular evangelical magazine Christianity Today to show that evangelical elites have developed a series of anti-homosexuality narratives that allow them to resist attribution effects. In particular, we find that even when evangelical elites have expressed belief in the physiological origins of homosexuality, such as the influence of genetics and/or prenatal hormones, their negative beliefs about the moral acceptability of homosexual behavior have not varied. We argue, then, that evangelical elites' anti-homosexuality narratives provide them with a strategy for influencing rank-and-file evangelicals, so that while allowing for a diversity of beliefs about the origins of homosexuality, rank-and-file evangelicals still have a viable mechanism for connecting these beliefs-whatever they may be-to negative beliefs about the moral acceptability of homosexual behavior. Our findings thus extend attribution theory, illuminate the potential power of moral narratives, and amplify the need for future research.  2015 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1463;2015;While previous work has examined the structure of public opinion on church and state, to date there has been little effort to connect public opinion on this group of issues to vote choice. I begin by hypothesizing that attitudes on religious establishment are distinct from attitudes on more often studied issues like abortion and gay marriage. Second, I argue that religious establishment meets the conditions for partisan voting: the parties and candidates have taken distinct, highly public stands on religious establishment, and the issue is highly salient among a certain segment of voters. Finally, I develop a theory that establishment attitudes should exert a greater impact among those individuals who feel that their values are threatened in contemporary society because such individuals may see religious accommodation as a means of returning to their understanding of traditional values. I test these hypotheses using data from the 2008 Cooperative Campaign Analysis Project, and I find considerable support for my argument.  2016 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1464;2015;While sociologists have long argued that higher education has a secularizing influence, recent research emphasizes the moderating role of social contexts in the relationship between social class and religion. I extend this line of research by examining sources of cross-national variation in the association between higher education and religiosity using survey data from more than 46,000 respondents in 39 nations. Multilevel models of a religiosity scale show (1) in the aggregate, higher education has a moderate, negative effect on the religiosity scale, (2) this effect varies considerably across nations, and (3) the negative effect of higher education on religiosity is most robust in relatively religious nations. These results demonstrate the importance of national contexts in moderating the effect of education on religiosity. The results also support a cultural diffusion argument that suggests that the highly educated are innovators and early adopters of secular behaviors but that low levels of religiosity then diffuse to less-educated segments of a population as secularity becomes more common.  2015 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
1465;2015;Women's autonomy has frequently been linked with women's opportunities and investments, such as education, employment, and reproductive control. The association between women's autonomy and religion in the developing world, however, has received less attention, and the few existing studies make comparisons across major religious traditions. In this study, we focus on variations in levels of female decision-making autonomy within a single religious tradition-Christianity. Using unique survey data from a predominantly Christian area in Mozambique, we devise an autonomy scale and apply it to compare women affiliated with different Christian denominations as well as unaffiliated women. In addition to affiliation, we examine the relationship between autonomy and women's religious agency both within and outside their churches. Multivariate analyses show that women belonging to more liberal religious traditions (such as Catholicism and mainline Protestantism) tend to have higher autonomy levels, regardless of other factors. These results are situated within the cross-national scholarship on religion and women's empowerment and are interpreted in the context of gendered religious dynamics in Mozambique and similar developing settings.  2015 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.
